Using only Flow, we’d miss runtime errors that could arise when we read from JSON and the schema doesn’t match what we thought it was. (This has happened already, albeit benignly!) Using only PropTypes, we have less expressive types (e.g., there’s only one function type, `PropTypes.func`), and we have less integration with the rest of our Flow-typed logic.\r\n\r\nThere exists a plugin, `babel-plugin-flow-react-proptypes`, that enables you to only _write_ Flow types, and have the PropTypes generated from the Flow types at compilation time. We can’t use it directly before ejecting from `create-react-app`, but I tried it out anyway and it seems to do the job perfectly on our existing code. (See below to repro yourself.)\r\n\r\nI think that this plugin is a good candidate, and that we should strongly consider using it after ejecting (and maybe consider ejecting in order to use it). What do you think?\r\n\r\ncc: @dandelionmane\r\n\r\nTo try it out:\r\n\r\n 1. Check out c1b37fa729a8d3802fe2c3a4ee4923e958ac4f8d (master, at the time of writing).\r\n 2. Apply the patch listed below, then `yarn install`.\r\n 3. Manually edit the file `node_modules/babel-preset-react-app/index.js`, to add the line\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    require.resolve('babel-plugin-flow-react-proptypes'),  // XXX\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    at the top of the `const plugins` array.\r\n 4. Manually edit the file `node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.dev.js`, changing the unique occurrence of `cacheDirectory: true` to `cacheDirectory: false` (may not be strictly necessary, depending on your state).\r\n 5. Run `yarn flow`, and note that everything checks out. Run `yarn start`, and note that the app functions without error.\r\n 6. Introduce a type error that would not cause a hard JS error in render: say, in `UserExplorer.js`, change `<UserEntry userId={author} ... />` to `<UserEntry userId={55} />`.\r\n 7. Run `yarn flow`, and note the helpful static errors. Run `yarn start`, and note the helpful runtime errors.\r\n 8. Note that `CI=true yarn test` is still green.\r\n\r\nThe above workflow isn’t production-ready because of the step in which you manually edit the contents of some node modules. After ejecting, these steps would be replaced by editing some config files within our repo, which is totally fine.\r\n\r\nThe patch mentioned in step 2 appears below:\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><strong>Contents of patch</strong> to automatically generate PropTypes from Flow types</summary>\r\n\r\nSave the following block to a file `/tmp/patch`, then `git apply </tmp/patch`.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/explorer/package.json b/explorer/package.json\r\nindex 4791b63..e698ff1 100644\r\n--- a/explorer/package.json\r\n+++ b/explorer/package.json\r\n@@ -3,6 +3,7 @@\r\n   \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\r\n   \"private\": true,\r\n   \"dependencies\": {\r\n+    \"babel-plugin-flow-react-proptypes\": \"^17.1.2\",\r\n     \"flow-bin\": \"^0.65.0\",\r\n     \"react\": \"^16.2.0\",\r\n     \"react-dom\": \"^16.2.0\",\r\ndiff --git a/explorer/src/App.js b/explorer/src/App.js\r\nindex 51d1081..19c182f 100644\r\n--- a/explorer/src/App.js\r\n+++ b/explorer/src/App.js\r\n@@ -1,10 +1,12 @@\r\n+// @flow\r\n import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n import data from './data.json';\r\n import './App.css';\r\n import { FileExplorer } from './FileExplorer.js';\r\n import { UserExplorer } from './UserExplorer.js';\r\n \r\n-class App extends Component {\r\n+type AppState = {selectedPath: string, selectedUser: ?string};\r\n+class App extends Component<{}, AppState> {\r\n   constructor() {\r\n     super();\r\n     this.state = {\r\ndiff --git a/explorer/src/FileExplorer.js b/explorer/src/FileExplorer.js\r\nindex 41f11cc..24eaad6 100644\r\n--- a/explorer/src/FileExplorer.js\r\n+++ b/explorer/src/FileExplorer.js\r\n@@ -1,15 +1,13 @@\r\n+// @flow\r\n import React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n-import PropTypes from 'prop-types';\r\n import {buildTree} from './commitUtils';\r\n-import {propTypes as commitUtilsPropTypes} from './commitUtils';\r\n-\r\n-export class FileExplorer extends Component {\r\n-  static propTypes = {\r\n-    selectedPath: PropTypes.string,\r\n-    onSelectPath: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\r\n-    data: commitUtilsPropTypes.commitData.isRequired,\r\n-  }\r\n+import type {CommitData, FileTree} from './commitUtils';\r\n \r\n+export class FileExplorer extends Component<{\r\n+    selectedPath: string,\r\n+    onSelectPath: (newPath: string) => void,\r\n+    data: CommitData,\r\n+}> {\r\n   render() {\r\n     // within the FileExplorer, paths start with \"./\", outside they don't\r\n     // which is hacky and should be cleaned up\r\n@@ -38,19 +36,16 @@ export class FileExplorer extends Component {\r\n   }\r\n }\r\n \r\n-class FileEntry extends Component {\r\n-  static propTypes = {\r\n-    name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\r\n-    path: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\r\n-    alwaysExpand: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,\r\n-\r\n-    // The type for the tree is recursive, and is annoying to specify as\r\n-    // a proptype.

For each individual component-specific interaction, we can test the logic via unit tests.

Following is a brain-dump of the current state of affairs as of 2018-02-22-ish, as developed in conversations between @dandelionmane and myself.\r\n\r\n## First attempt: the project DAG\r\n\r\nOriginally, we considered the following scheme.\r\n\r\nThe _project graph_ is a DAG whose nodes are primarily _contributions_: contributions include commits, pull requests, issues, comments on PRs and issues, design docs, etc. A weighted edge from *a* to *b* indicates that *b* provided value to *a* (in proportion to the edge weight). The leaf nodes of the graph correspond to users. There is only one instance of this graph, which serves as a reflection of the repository’s “official”/“objective” value function. Individuals can update the graph by standard pull requests (and maybe also via some lower-friction, continuous workflows; details to be fleshed out).\r\n\r\nThere is a root node in the graph representing the repository as a whole. The graph will likely also include “subprojects”, which may be functional areas of the application (“frontend”, “backend”, “plugins”), organizational divisions (“buildcop”, “triage”), or anything else that is perceived as important to the organization.\r\n\r\nAt allocation time, one unit of cred is minted to the root node. The cred “flows down” the graph, roughly according to the following algorithm. Let *n* be a node all of whose parents have been visited, and let *c* be the amount of cred that has flowed to *n*; then, to each child *n*′ of *n* with normalized edge-weight *p*, flow *p*&nbsp;*c* cred to *n*′. Repeat until all nodes have been visited. Each user receives cred proportional to the amount of cred at their respective leaf node.\r\n\r\nOne particularly desirable property of this mechanism is that it is _transparent_ in the following sense. Suppose that we want to understand the distribution of impact among users for some subcomponent of the project: e.g., we want to see who has contributed the most value to the backend APIs. We can rerun the algorithm on the same project graph, but mint 1¤ to the “backend APIs” node instead of the root project node. The results will be useful because the process is _additive_. For instance, if a project has a root node with two children—“backend”, with weight 0.6; and “frontend”, with weight 0.4—then a user’s cred will be _c_<sub>total</sub> = 0.6 · _c_<sub>backend</sub> + 0.4 · _c_<sub>frontend</sub>, where _c_<sub>_u_</sub> is the credit assigned to the user when the search starts from node _u_.\r\n\r\n## Second attempt: the project graph\r\n\r\nA major problem with this approach is the requirement that the graph be acyclic. We expect cyclic project graphs to be quite common in reality. (TODO: Provide examples.) In such cases, the process described above no longer directly applies. Instead, we would like to continue flowing cred along edges until we reach some kind of equilibrium.\r\n\r\nNote that if we interpret a project DAG as a Markov chain, then the process described above can also be formulated as, “find the distribution of the chain after a large number of steps when starting from a distribution that is at the root node with probability 1”. Markov chains generalize to graphs with cycles, so we will attempt to formulate an improved version of the system along these lines. An immediate problem is that the chain is not likely to be ergodic—users will be leaf nodes, so will not communicate with other states—so we will have to be careful when dealing with limiting and stationary distributions.\r\n\r\nA natural first idea is to simply take the limit distribution *π*₀ *A*<sup>*k*</sup> for large *k*, where *π*₀ is the distribution that has 1 for the root node and 0 elsewhere. Then, we could restrict the support of the resulting distribution to the nodes corresponding to users, and after normalization we would have a valid allocation. While this seems reasonable so far, it is not clear how to achieve the transparency discussed above. The strategy of “assign 1¤ to an arbitrary project node and re-run as normal” does not obviously do the right thing: if the chain is ergodic, then changing the initial conditions does not affect the limiting distribution, and a densely connected graph may be “nearly ergodic” enough for the cred to become “all mixed up”. (As you might guess from reading this paragraph, the precise dynamics of what goes right and wrong, and how, are not clear to me. It might be helpful to run a simple version of these algorithms on some toy repos and some real-world repos to explore the behavior.)\r\n\r\nMore info to be posted in this thread.","title":"Design core data models"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000039\u0000":{"address":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"39","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/39","comments":[{"type":"COMMENT","id":"407174095","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"39","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"Since SourceCred's main data structure is a graph, we're going to want to build a tool for visualizing it.\r\n\r\n## some properties of the problem\r\n\r\n### fractal graph, meaningful at different levels of scale\r\n\r\nthe graph will span levels of abstraction from the repository and project level (visualize GitHub projects as nodes, edges are dependencies between projects) down to the individual commit and comment level (a pull request is a node with edges to all its comments, and edges to its commits, and to the files it modifies).\r\n\r\nthe graph visualizer should be able to seamlessly transition between these levels of scale, and explore the boundaries in between (e.g. the specific artifacts that create connections across repository boundaries)\r\n\r\n### some nodes will have very high degree\r\n\r\nfor example, user nodes will have an edge to every contribution and comment they have ever authored. we'll need to abstract over cases like this, rather than overwhelm the display\r\n\r\n### some nodes are much more important than others\r\n\r\nso we will want to surface highest-importance nodes within the viewing context, and maybe aggregate less important nodes together. fortunately, we will have a metric (cred) for determining the relative importance of nodes (that's the whole point! 😄)\r\n\r\n### heterogenous node and edge types\r\n\r\nthe nodes and edges are provided by plugins (see: #26) and each plugin may have its own logic for how to display that node or edge. the UI will need a plugin area that provides this context.\r\n\r\n## my current vision\r\n\r\nWhat I'm imagining right now is a zoom-and-pannable \"map\" depicting nodes and edges. To get some inspiration, please take a look at the [TensorFlow graph explorer].\r\n\r\nAt any time, there is an active \"scope\" that determines which part of the graph is being visualized; the scope can be global (show most important K repos, and edges between them), repo specific (show most important K projects and contributions, with edges between them), user specific (show most important contributions that user has made, and edges...), etc.\r\n\r\nFor any given scope, most of the graph will be hidden, either by being abstracted into aggregate nodes, or just elided from view. Plugins should be able to define their own scoping logic; for example, the GitHub plugin may define comments get scoped with their containing issue or pull request. \r\n\r\nThe user should be able to interactively explore the graph, both by drilling down into scopes (e.g. click on an aggregated node to expand it an explore its contents), and by traversing the graph to different locations (e.g. follow a path of package dependencies to core deps). \r\n\r\nIn contrast to the TensorFlow graph explorer, I don't expect that there will be a canonical fixed layout that the whole graph fits into; instead, the layout is determined dynamically, possibly via [force directed layout](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045) or similar.\r\n\r\nAlso in contrast to the TF graph explorer, I'd like exploring the graph to have a continuous and organic feel. Consider how in Google maps, you can gently zoom in across different levels of scale, vs. in the TF graph explorer, nodes expand/collapse as single discrete events.\r\n\r\n## next steps: unblock a MVP\r\n\r\nWe're going to want a MVP of the graph explorer as soon as our GitHub plugin starts collecting data - it will be invaluable in the process of designing and testing cred allocation algorithms, as well as exploring the data our plugins collect and seeing what kinds of insights they surface.\r\n\r\n### choose our tech\r\n\r\nTo that end, we should decide on a basic technology stack, one that will enable fast iteration and prototyping while still putting us on sound footing for long term maintenance. I think starting with d3+svg for the frontend will be best for fast prototyping, although we should consider keeping the rendering cleanly decoupled so that we can consider switching to more performant options down the line. \r\n\r\nLayout, node aggregation, and graph logic needs to be in well-tested, flow-typed javascript. That kind of logic can get quite hairy and we're gonna want to strive for great test coverage and modularity, lest we get caught in a complexity trap.\r\n\r\nI plan to reach out to @doug, @kanitw, @dsmilkov, @nsthorat, and @chihuahua, all of whom were very influential in creating and maintaining the TF graph explorer, for their technical judgment on what approaches are best. \r\n\r\ncc: @wchargin ","title":"design a graph visualizer"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000040\u0000":{"address":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"40","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/40","comments":[{"type":"COMMENT","id":"387147792","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"40","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"The GitHub plugin will be responsible for sourcing the following types of information:\r\n\r\nNodes:\r\n- Pull requests\r\n- Issues\r\n- Issue comments\r\n  n.b. the body of an issue (or PR) is treated as its first \"issue comment\"\r\n- Commit comments\r\n- Review comments\r\n- GitHub user identities\r\n\r\nEdges:\r\n- authorship \r\n  users author the other nodes, e.g. user authors commit\r\n- containership \r\n  issues and pull requests contain comments\r\n  *(might merge with reference below)*\r\n- reference \r\n  comments can reference other nodes, e.g. the line below where this issue comment references PR-35\r\n\r\nThis is based off the overall plugin architecture design (#26); implementation has started in 'Add types for GitHub plugin' (#35)","title":"Plugins: GitHub plugin"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000041\u0000":{"address":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"41","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/41","comments":[],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"The artifact plugin organizes the contribution graph according to the boundaries that are set by human interpretation.

I think \"git addresses\" (look up in repository at URL X), and ipfs content addresses should both be handled well by our addressing scheme.\r\n\r\nNote that this is an increase in flexibility from the \"repositoryName/pluginName\" system. It will still be the case that some ValueNets are owned by individual repositories (e.g. SourceCred owns the SourceCredArtifact net) but it is a more flexible abstraction.\r\n\r\nExplicit goal: Someone should be able to fork any individual value network, and still play nicely with all the other networks, including the forked network.","title":"Address semantics and \"Value Networks\""},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000074\u0000":{"address":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"74","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/74","comments":[{"type":"COMMENT","id":"374434248","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"74","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"We can’t use ES6 modules with our backend scripts, because we refuse to\r\nacquiesce to the the `.mjs` autocracy that Node is trying to impose.\r\nWe’ve been using the old `module.exports` system, but this doesn’t let\r\nus import and export Flow types.

We can do this very simply by adding a fourth string field with name `type` onto the Address. However, there are two nontrivial considerations here:\r\n\r\n1. Can we make the type system aware of the type string? In the GitHub plugin, we had explicit types for every ID type (e.g. `IssueNodeID`, `CommentNodeID`) and it seems natural to move that to the address layer now - in which case we get\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Address<T: string> {|\r\n  +type: T,\r\n...\r\n|]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could express that that constructing a node with a <FooPayload> and a \"BAR\" address type is a type error, but it's been difficult to properly express that in the Github plugin. We might wind up creating dual type signatures for each Node/Edge, as in the Github plugin, which I expect would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Node<Type, PayloadType> {|\r\n  +address: Address<Type>,\r\n  +payload: PayloadType,\r\n|}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we could define a `TYPES` dict like \r\n```\r\nTYPES = {|\r\n  FOOTYPE: FooPayloadType,\r\n  BARTYPE: BarPayloadType,\r\n|}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's another question of whether type names should be implicitly scoped by plugin, or if there should be \"generic\" types that are shared across plugins. Having generic type names adds complexity because then we need to do namescoping / disambiguation of types across plugins; it would be simpler to just have each type name be specific to the plugin that generates it, because then we can depend on plugin namespacing to prevent conflicts. So I think we should take that approach, and possibly revisit if we have a compelling case where we need to share a type across multiple plugins.\r\n\r\n@wchargin - if you don't object to the general approach, I'll likely take a stab at refactoring this into the codebase soon - the sooner we switch to the right object type for Address, the less re-factoring we'll need to do down the line.","title":"Refactor \"NodeTypes\" and \"EdgeTypes\" to be part of the Address"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000117\u0000":{"address":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"117","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/117","comments":[{"type":"COMMENT","id":"379634100","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"117","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},{"type":"COMMENT","id":"379634273","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"117","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},{"type":"COMMENT","id":"379634294","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"117","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"When we request data from the GitHub API, we are limited to a maximum of\r\n100 items per connection at a time: 100 issues per repository, 100\r\ncomments per issue, etc. When we want to fetch _all_ data for a\r\nrepository, we’ll need to take advantage of GitHub’s pagination API to\r\nfetch subsequent pages. Currently, our code assumes (and asserts) that\r\nall data always fits on a single page, but clearly this is not a\r\nscalable long-term solution: SourceCred itself will soon have more than\r\n100 pull requests, for instance.\r\n\r\nEventually, we would like to implement an “auto-pagination” function\r\nthat takes an arbitrary query against the GitHub API, executes it, and\r\nkeeps fetching subsequent pages until all data has been exhausted. I’ve\r\nbeen working on this for a while (order of a week), and it is\r\nfascinatingly difficult. Without going into too much detail: for a fully\r\ngeneral solution, we need to map each field in the response to the field\r\nin the query and the associated GraphQL type, which gets complicated\r\nwhen dealing with fragments, and further complicated when fragments have\r\noverlapping support.

One potential explanation\r\nfor this is that the abuse detection depends on actual compute resources\r\nused by GitHub’s servers, and so initial queries cause the caches to be\r\nhot for the particular resources in question.

Submodule commits\r\nchange the has-contents relationship from “a tree entry has exactly one\r\nnode as contents” to “a tree entry has zero or more nodes as contents”.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the contents of a tree entry representing a submodule\r\ncommit cannot be determined by looking at the tree in Git. For a fixed\r\ntree entry, the contents may even change over time as new commits are\r\nadded to the head of the repository—without force-pushes or anything.\r\n\r\nThis is all quite confusing, and of questionable value (which, of\r\ncourse, is my fault).\r\n\r\nThe reason that I originally implemented the system like this is the\r\nfollowing. In Git, the actual tree entry for a submodule commit as\r\nshown by `git cat-file -p HEAD^{tree}` or `git cat-file tree HEAD | xxd`\r\nincludes only the name of the submodule (as with all tree entries) and\r\nthe submodule commit hash. Armed with only the hash, one cannot find\r\nmore information about the remote commit, because one does not know how\r\nto locate the repository to which it belongs. Including the URL helped\r\nto remedy this; it gave one a place to look up the commit and find its\r\nauthor, its contents, etc.\r\n\r\nBut, in the context of a SourceCred graph, I don’t think that this makes\r\nmuch sense. Suppose that we have a cred graph for Repositories A and B,\r\nand that Repository A has submodule commits from Repositories B and C.\r\nGiven just the hash of a submodule commit from Repository B, the\r\nrelevant commit is already in the graph, so we can get all the\r\ninformation that we want. Given the hash of a submodule commit from\r\nRepository C, we can’t get any more information about this commit—but we\r\ndon’t need to, either. What were we going to do with the URL—hope that\r\nthe repository is still mirrored there, go clone it, and generate a cred\r\ngraph on the fly? Doubtful.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should consider moving to the following ontology, which is\r\nsimpler and a more faithful model of Git:\r\n\r\n  - A tree includes tree entries.\r\n  - A tree entry may have a blob as contents.\r\n  - A tree entry may have a tree as contents.\r\n  - A tree entry may have a commit as contents.\r\n\r\nHere are some consequences:\r\n\r\n  - We get invariants like “every tree entry has exactly one node as\r\n    contents”. Consequently, both APIs and implementations become\r\n    simpler.\r\n\r\n  - We don’t have to read the `.gitmodules` file at every commit. This\r\n    saves (a) for every commit: one `git` subprocess call that must read\r\n    and parse a tree object, and (b) for commits that have at least one\r\n    submodule, one additional `git` subprocess call that must read and\r\n    parse a blob. It is probably a marginal performance improvement, but\r\n    it makes the code significantly simpler.\r\n\r\n  - We must relax the invariant that every commit have exactly one tree:\r\n    in the case of a submodule commit, we might not know what the\r\n    appropriate tree is. I posit that this is okay. The invariant\r\n    changes from a uniqueness constraint to a subsingleton constraint.\r\n\r\n  - It is increasingly apparent that the Git graph is not a graph of one\r\n    Git repository, but of all Git repositories.

In the interest of concreteness, here is a sample of of node types\r\nand edge types we have or expect to add.\r\n\r\n### Node types:\r\n\r\n  - *GitHub users* are identities we want to assign cred to\r\n  - *GitHub issues* contain documentation, design, bug reports, etc\r\n  - *GitHub pull requests* merge new code into the repository\r\n  - *Git blobs* contain source code\r\n  - *Spotlights* represent cred for contributions that don't otherwise fit\r\n    into the data model, e.g. a spotlight for participtaing in an offline\r\n    design discussion, or for giving a talk on SourceCred\r\n\r\n### Edge types:\r\n\r\n - *Authorship edges* connect an issue or pull request with the users that\r\n   created it\r\n - *MergedAs edges* connect a pull request to the git commit it created\r\n - *Import edges* connect a Git blob containing source code to the git blobs\r\n   containing code that blob imports\r\n - *Spotlight edges* connect a Spotlight node to the entities it is flowing cred\r\n   to\r\n - *Spotlight authorships* flow some cred to the entity that created the spotlight\r\n\r\n\r\n### The need for weights\r\n\r\nAs currently implemented, SourceCred does not do a good job of distinguishing\r\nvaluable contributions. As an example, when run on the repository in its\r\ncurrent state, it believes that #292 is one of the most valuable pulls in the\r\nproject, outshining contributions like #252 and #468 which were actually much\r\nmore valuable. Even worse, it massively over-values Git objects; for example,\r\nthe blob containing our Prettier configuration is seen as >100x more valuable\r\nthan the most valuable pull request.\r\n\r\n@wchargin and @decentralion believe that this problem results from the fact\r\nthat the graph is currently unweighted. As such, we need to implement a system\r\nfor applying weights to different nodes and to the src/dst of edges. There are\r\nseveral different use cases for weights:\r\n\r\n### Kinds of weights:\r\n\r\n#### Prior over types\r\n\r\nWeights can provide prior information on the relative value of different types.\r\nFor example, we should have a weight that suggests that GitHub pull requests\r\nare, on average, much more important than Git blobs.\r\n\r\n#### Domain-specific evaluation\r\n\r\nWeights can use domain-specific signal to differentiate the value of different\r\nnodes of the same type. For example, # of lines of code is a useful signal for\r\nthe value of a pull request; a PR that modifies 1000 lines of code is probably\r\nmore valuable than one that modifies 3 lines.\r\n\r\n#### Distinguish parts of the project\r\n\r\nWeights can be used to differentiate different parts of the project for clearer\r\nanalysis. For example, suppose a project wants to separately measure cred for\r\n\"backend\" and \"frontend\" work, without artificially partioning the project into\r\nseparate graphs. It would be nice to do this via a \"weighting\" that assigns a\r\nhigh prior weight to the backend directory and key backend APIs. (This would\r\nincorporate the [project] or \"domain\" concept via weighting).\r\n\r\n[project]:\r\nhttps://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/29#issuecomment-368359785\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, implementing a well-designed weighting abstraction would allow us to\r\nimplement many important features in a cohesive way. What follows is a \"Q&A\"\r\nstyle discussion of major open questions in how the weight abstraction should\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n## Open questions\r\n\r\n### What is the type signature of a weight function?\r\n\r\nIn some cases, it's natural to think of a weight function as providing a\r\nrelative weight over every node in the project. For example, the project may\r\nhave maintainer-configurable weight functions that give a prior over every type\r\nof node in te graph\r\n\r\nIn other cases, it's natural to think of a weight function as providing\r\nrelative weights for a subset of nodes in the graph. For example, the\r\nlines-of-code weighting can differentiate between different pull request nodes,\r\nbut has no information to offer on the relative importance of different issues.\r\n\r\nSome ideas on how we could express weight functions:\r\n\r\n`node \\in Graph -> number`, where for some subset of nodes in the graph, the\r\nweight function assigns a weight. That weight might be seen as an update on the\r\na priori importance of the node. (What would the formal specification be?)\r\n\r\n\r\n`Graph -> distribution over nodes`, where for every node in the graph, the\r\nweight function assigns an update on the prior importance of that node. (Would\r\nit assign 0 to every node that is out-of-scope? Would that compose nicely?)\r\n\r\n### How do we compose weight functions?\r\n\r\nIt's important that we can combine and compose weight functions. For example,\r\nsuppose we have one weight function on commits that gives the logarithm of the\r\nnumber of lines changed by the commit, and another weight function measures the\r\n[cyclomatic complexity]. At the very least, we should be able to use both\r\nweight functions in tandem.  It would be cool if we could express richer\r\nrelationships, such as that commits that add a lot of lines of code but do not\r\nadd any test code actually have negative signal.  (Unless they are refactors?)\r\n\r\ncyclomatic complexity: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity]\r\n\r\nWe should also be able to compose weight functions \"cross-product-style\".\r\nSuppose we have one pair of weight functions that distinguishes the frontend\r\nand backend components, and we have another pair of weight functions that\r\ndistinguishes code implementation from documentation.\r\n\r\nThen it should be possible to answer who has the most documentation cred in the\r\nbackend, who has the most implementation cred in the frontend, and so forth.\r\n\r\nOne insight from @krzhang was to think of the weight functions as priors in a\r\nsequence of bayesian updates; he suggested that if we store the weights as\r\nlog-priors, then combining them is as simple as adding the log-priors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How do we apply the weight functions to the PageRank algorithm?\r\n\r\nClassical PageRank doesn't provide prior weighting on nodes. One way to add\r\nweighting, found in the weighting around [personalized PageRank], is to add\r\n[personalization vectors].  This modifies the \"random surfing\" or\r\n\"teleportation\" of the PageRank algorithm so that rather than uniformly\r\nteleporting to any node in the graph, the surfer teleports based on the\r\npersonalization vector.\r\n\r\n[personalized PageRank]: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/pagerank.shtml\r\n[personalization vectors]: http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/596/1/2003-35.pdf\r\n\r\nIn offline discussion, @krzhang suggested a different approach. We can apply a\r\nnode weight by applying a weighting to the in-and-out edge weights for that\r\nnode; i.e., by modifying that node's row and column in the adjacency matrix.\r\n\r\nHe suggested that given an adjacency matrix `M`, this could be applied by `W *\r\nM * W'`, where `W` is a diagonal matrix with node weights on the diagonal.\r\n\r\nThis approach seems more powerful and principled to me - easier to reason about\r\nhow it affects the final distribution. We may want to empirically try both approaches.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet's use this thread to further discuss this model; eventually we'll likely want to commit the final document as a markdown or latex document.\r\n\r\nThanks to @krzhang for helping to clarify the problem domain, and providing a number of suggestions that informed this post.","title":"Weighted PageRank"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000481\u0000":{"address":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"481","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/481","comments":[{"type":"COMMENT","id":"402268298","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"481","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"Our current GitHub reference detection uses regular expressions to\r\nextract known reference patterns from a block of text.

For instance, in the current system, the string\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/1#@foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nparses to two references (!):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"refType\": \"BASIC\",\r\n    \"ref\": \"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/1\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"ref\": \"@foo\",\r\n    \"refType\": \"BASIC\"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because a URL is allowed to end in a fragment specifier `#`,\r\nwhich is not a word character `[A-Za-z0-9_]`, and a username reference\r\nis required to be preceded by a non-word character.\r\n\r\nBecause the regular expressions used to match the different reference\r\ntypes all execute independently, it is hard to reason about scenarios\r\nlike this one. The reader must consider the cross product of “the end of\r\none regular expression” and “the start of another”, for instance. Of\r\ncourse, attempting to combine all the different reference types into one\r\ngiant regular expression would likely be a bad idea, especially\r\nconsidering that paired-with references work by computing a difference\r\nof regular expression matches.\r\n\r\nHowever, suppose that we reconsider the premise of using a regular\r\nexpression to find references _globally_ in a string. Instead, we may\r\nconvert the input to a stream of tokens, and then make a single pass\r\nover that token stream, identifying all kinds of references at once. We\r\ncan use similar, but simpler, regular expressions to check whether a\r\nparticular _token_ is particular kind of reference. Then, these\r\nexpressions wouldn’t need to worry about adding non-capturing groups\r\n`(?:\\W|^)` and lookaheads `(?=\\W|$)` for detecting word boundaries (and\r\nthe [resulting subtleties][#478] that this entails).\r\n\r\nWe would also gain the ability to reason more clearly about interactions\r\nby modifying state as we traverse the token stream: for instance, the\r\nrule “if you see the token `Paired` followed by the token `with`, then\r\nthe next token is considered to be a paired-with reference instead of a\r\nusername reference” is easy to express, and eliminates the need for the\r\nfunky multiset-difference in the current implementation. For parsing URL\r\nreferences, we would gain the ability to defer to an actual URL-parsing\r\nlibrary to handle all the special cases that we’re likely to forget.\r\n\r\n[#478]: https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/478\r\n\r\nIn summary, I suspect that the resulting system would be a simple state\r\nmachine that is easy to understand.\r\n\r\nNote that hand-writing a tokenizer is quite easy, and could plausibly\r\nrequire not much more than `(s) => s.split(\" \")`.\r\n\r\nThis change would be highly self-contained; only the `parseReferences`\r\nmodule would need to change.

The snapshot format is designed to be\r\nhuman-readable and -auditable so that it can serve as documentation.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nRun the application with `yarn start`.

This is done in such a way that reasonable additions to the\r\nquery will not be hard to implement—for instance, if we want to fetch\r\na new kind of field, the marginal cost is at most a bit of extra\r\ncopy-and-paste and some modifications to tests. However, we should\r\ncertainly still plan to implement the fully automatic pagination system\r\ndescribed in #117.\r\n\r\nRunning on TensorBoard with the default page limits takes 30–33 seconds\r\nover 7 queries, uses 103 GitHub API points (out of 5000 for any given\r\nhour), and produces a JSON file that is 8.7MB (when pretty-printed).\r\nThis all seems quite reasonable to me.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nExtensive unit tests added. The snapshots are quite readable, by design.\r\n\r\nFor a real-world test, you can `yarn start` the artifact viewer and use\r\nthe GUI to fetch the data for tensorflow/tensorboard.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate that the fetching process gives the same results\r\nregardless of the page size, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n 1. In `fetchGithubRepo.js`’s `postQuery` function, insert a new\r\n    statement `console.error(\"Posting query...\")` at the beginning. (It\r\n    is important to print to stderr instead of stdout.)\r\n 2. Run `yarn backend` and then invoke `fetchGithubRepo.js` on a repo\r\n    large enough to require pagination, like SourceCred or TensorBoard.\r\n    Pipe the result to `shasum -a 256` and note the SHA.\r\n 3.

The result is the blob SHA.\r\n\r\nTo run a sanity-check on a large repository: apply the following patch:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Patch to print out statistics about loaded repository</summary>\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/config/paths.js b/config/paths.js\r\nindex d2f25fb..8fa2023 100644\r\n--- a/config/paths.js\r\n+++ b/config/paths.js\r\n@@ -62,5 +62,6 @@ module.exports = {\r\n     fetchAndPrintGithubRepo: resolveApp(\r\n       \"src/plugins/github/bin/fetchAndPrintGithubRepo.js\"\r\n     ),\r\n+    loadRepository: resolveApp(\"src/plugins/git/loadRepository.js\"),\r\n   },\r\n };\r\ndiff --git a/src/plugins/git/loadRepository.js b/src/plugins/git/loadRepository.js\r\nindex a76b66c..9380941 100644\r\n--- a/src/plugins/git/loadRepository.js\r\n+++ b/src/plugins/git/loadRepository.js\r\n@@ -106,3 +106,7 @@ function findTrees(git: GitDriver, rootTrees: Set<Hash>): Tree[] {\r\n   }\r\n   return result;\r\n }\r\n+\r\n+const result = loadRepository(...process.argv.slice(2));\r\n+console.log(\"commits\", result.commits.size);\r\n+console.log(\"trees\", result.trees.size);\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThen, run `yarn backend` and put the following script in `test.sh`:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Contents for `test.sh`</summary>\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nset -eu\r\n\r\nrepo=\"$1\"\r\nref=\"$2\"\r\n\r\nvia_node() {\r\n    node bin/loadRepository.js \"${repo}\" \"${ref}\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nvia_git() (\r\n    cd \"${repo}\"\r\n    printf 'commits '\r\n    git rev-list \"${ref}\" | wc -l\r\n    printf 'trees '\r\n    git rev-list \"${ref}\" |\r\n        while read -r commit; do\r\n            git rev-parse \"${commit}^{tree}\"\r\n            git ls-tree -rt \"${commit}\" \\\r\n                | grep ' tree ' \\\r\n                | cut -f 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 3\r\n        done | sort | uniq | wc -l\r\n)\r\n\r\necho\r\nprintf 'Running directly via git...\\n'\r\ntime a=\"$(via_git)\"\r\n\r\necho\r\nprintf 'Running Node script...\\n'\r\ntime b=\"$(via_node)\"\r\n\r\ndiff -u <(cat <<<\"${a}\") <(cat <<<\"${b}\")\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nFinally, run `./test.sh /path/to/some/repo origin/master`, and verify\r\nthat it exits successfully (zero diff).

This might\r\nhappen if, for instance, calling `stdout.toString()` takes a really long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAlso, these timings should not be considered indicative of the\r\nindividual performance of any particular task. As tasks compete for CPU\r\nand other resources, the elapsed time of one task depends greatly on the\r\nother tasks running at the same time. For instance, using the set of\r\ntasks given by\r\n```js\r\nconst n = 10;\r\nreturn Array(n)\r\n  .fill(null)\r\n  .map((_, i) => ({\r\n    id: \"check-pretty-\" + String(i),\r\n    cmd: [\"npm\", \"run\", \"--silent\", \"check-pretty\"],\r\n    deps: [],\r\n  }));\r\n```\r\nwe see that all tasks are reported to take about the same amount of\r\ntime, but that time varies dramatically with `n`: for `n=1` it is\r\napproximately 4s, while for `n=10` it is approximately 24s. This can be\r\npartially mitigated by inspecting the output of `time(1)`, but not\r\nentirely: even the “user” time varies by around a factor of 2 depending\r\non what other trasks are running.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means that we have inaccurate reportings like the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  - `backend` reportedly takes around 10.5s, but when run individually\r\n    takes only around 4.6s;\r\n  - `ci-test` is reported at 9.4s but actually takes only 4.4s;\r\n  - `lint` is reported at 8.8s but actually only takes 3.5s.\r\n\r\nWe _could_ try to mitigate this by including with each task a “hint” of\r\nhow many cores we expect it to peg (`ci-test` gets “all”, `backend` gets\r\n“just one”) and trying not to spawn more processes than there are cores.\r\nBut this sounds pretty fragile, so I haven’t made any efforts to do so.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nReplace the Travis config with the following, then run `yarn travis`:\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/config/travis.js b/config/travis.js\r\nindex be308d4..ba00a04 100644\r\n--- a/config/travis.js\r\n+++ b/config/travis.js\r\n@@ -16,6 +16,14 @@ function main() {\r\n }\r\n\r\n function makeTasks(mode /*: \"BASIC\" | \"FULL\" */) {\r\n+  return [\r\n+    {id: \"true\", cmd: [\"true\"], deps: []},\r\n+    {id: \"false\", cmd: [\"false\"], deps: []},\r\n+    {id: \"sleep-a\", cmd: [\"sleep\", \"2\"], deps: []},\r\n+    {id: \"sleep-b\", cmd: [\"sleep\", \"2\"], deps: []},\r\n+    {id: \"sleep-c\", cmd: [\"sleep\", \"2\"], deps: [\"sleep-b\"]},\r\n+    {id: \"never\", cmd: [\"echo\", \"wat\"], deps: [\"false\"]},\r\n+  ];\r\n   const basicTasks = [\r\n     {\r\n       id: \"ensure-flow-typing\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that both passing and failing tests have times printed, but\r\ntasks that never ran do not.

The graph’s serialized\r\nform also now stores edges with integer `src`/`dst` keys, but the node\r\nordering is canonicalized so that two graphs are logically equal if and\r\nonly if their serialized forms are equal. This change substantially\r\nreduces the rest storage space for graphs: the `sourcecred/sourcecred`\r\ngraph drops from 39MB to 30MB.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the graph will have to translate between integer indices and\r\nfull addresses at each client operation.

This commit unifies them.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's a bit weird in this design that `Edges` (which are\r\nnominally graph-agnostic) give `NodeReferences`, which are tied to\r\nspecific graphs. As implemented, graphs are permissive in that they will\r\naccept edges from other graphs, but careful in what they return, in that\r\nthe edges they return always contain references to their own nodes.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the case in general that adding an edge to a graph and\r\nrequesting it back gives a reference-identical edge; if the initial edge\r\ncontained references to a different graph, a new one is returned.\r\n\r\nAlso, the performance of this commit is not great, since internally the\r\nedges go through address translation a lot: in `neighbors`, `addEdge`,\r\n`removeEdge`, `toJSON`, `fromJSON`, etc. Most of these address\r\ntranslations are unnecessary; if we refactor to expose an module-private\r\nway to retrieve the index from an indexed `NodeReference`, we can solve\r\nall of these performance issues without breaking the API.\r\n\r\nTest plan: Many unit tests were added.","title":"Make Edges into Payload-esque objects","mergedAs":null,"additions":430,"deletions":267},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000325\u0000":{"address":{"type":"PULL","number":"325","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/325","comments":[{"type":"COMMENT","id":"393771196","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"325","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"reviews":[{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125025177","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"325","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125025483","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"325","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"Summary:\r\nThis fixes a bug introduced in #317, which only occurred in the cron job\r\nvariant of the CI script (`yarn travis --full`): the two scripts run in\r\nthe cron job depend on `yarn backend` having previously written to the\r\n`bin/` directory, but this is precisely what we wanted to prevent.

These addresses are\r\nexported as an opaque type; they can't be manipulated via standard\r\nstring methods, but instead require special address-aware methods.\r\nAddresses have path-like semantics (they are hierarchically orgnaized by\r\nstring components), and we expect to have methods for appending\r\ncomponents, finding prefixes, concatenting addresses, mapping them to\r\nand from string arrays, etc.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to attach these methods to the addresses, so it\r\nwould be possible to call `address.append(component)`,\r\n`address.prefix()`, and so forth. However, as addresses are strings,\r\nthis would require modifying the string prototype. We could make\r\naddresses classes instead, that are backed by or convertible to strings,\r\nbut this would break the ability to test address equality using `===`.\r\n\r\nAfter some offline discussion with @wchargin, we decided the best\r\ncompromise is to create a \"psuedo-module\" which contains all address\r\nrelated methods, and can be imported from the `core/graph` module. This\r\ncommit creates that module, called `Address`, which contains the\r\nfollowing methods:\r\n\r\n- `nodeAddress`: The factory function for node addresses. Returns a base\r\n`NodeAddress` if called without arguments, or constructs a componentized\r\naddress if called with an array of parts.\r\n\r\n- `edgeAddress`: The factory function for edge addresses. Returns a base\r\n`EdgeAddress` if called without arguments, or constructs a componentized\r\naddress if called with an array of parts.\r\n\r\n- `toParts`: Takes a node or edge address and returns a string array of\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nThe module is implemented in `address.js`. Clients are not intended to\r\nimport `address.js` directly; rather, `graph.js` re-exports the public\r\npieces. (This is just for clients' convenience; being able to import all\r\nGraph-required functionality from one file is pleasant.)\r\n\r\nA note about `NodeAddress` and `EdgeAddress`: There are actually two\r\ntypes of Addresses (Node and Edge), which have different\r\nrepresentations. It is a type and runtime error to pass a `NodeAddress` to\r\na function expecting an `EdgeAddress` and vice versa. Offline, @wchargin\r\nand I discussed exporting two psuedomodules, one for node and one for\r\nedge addresses. On further consideration, I believe this introduces\r\nneedless API complexity. It will be easy to write the single `Address`\r\nmodule with functions that are apprporiately generic over Node/Edge\r\naddresses, so we will still get type (and runtime) errors when passing\r\n(for example) an `EdgeAddress` into `Graph.hasNode`.\r\n\r\n`address.js` also exports `assertNodeAddress` and `assertEdgeAddress`.\r\nThese functions aren't yet used, but will be needed for appropriate\r\nruntime assertions in `Graph` methods.\r\n\r\nTest plan: Observe unit tests, Travis.","title":"Reorganize Graph address-related code","mergedAs":{"type":"COMMIT","hash":"754de1652404af1023cf1a5c05504b3cca3ff940"},"additions":248,"deletions":175},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000335\u0000":{"address":{"type":"PULL","number":"335","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/335","comments":[],"reviews":[{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125721219","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"335","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"Release notes: https://prettier.io/blog/2018/05/27/1.13.0.html","title":"Upgrade prettier to 1.13","mergedAs":{"type":"COMMIT","hash":"3ac051b16ce84e4f4dbc37fe95a182fdbd96e13f"},"additions":26,"deletions":20},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000337\u0000":{"address":{"type":"PULL","number":"337","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/337","comments":[],"reviews":[{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125745841","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"337","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"Summary:\r\nFixes breakage due to https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/327.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\n`yarn travis --full` now passes.\r\n\r\nwchargin-branch: src-v1-cron","title":"Update `src/v1/` paths for CI cron","mergedAs":{"type":"COMMIT","hash":"3e835764223c5c0c19d42112084f5bd53be25edf"},"additions":4,"deletions":4},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000338\u0000":{"address":{"type":"PULL","number":"338","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/338","comments":[],"reviews":[{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125747399","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"338","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"It still passes :)\r\n\r\nTest plan: Travis","title":"Upgrade flow to 0.73","mergedAs":{"type":"COMMIT","hash":"6585700c0cc424f4ea3620dffb671a2ecad957de"},"additions":4,"deletions":4},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000339\u0000":{"address":{"type":"PULL","number":"339","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/339","comments":[{"type":"COMMENT","id":"401516618","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"339","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"reviews":[{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125749456","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"339","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125756000","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"339","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"When the cron build fails, we want to make sure that we know about it.\r\nThis commit ensures that Travis emails @wchargin and @decentralion on\r\nany build failure; our email filters will ensure that cron job failures\r\nget noticed.\r\n\r\nBased on documentation at: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications","title":"Ensure build failure emails","mergedAs":{"type":"COMMIT","hash":"bd28030caadd433ba667345882ceb04d252083ee"},"additions":6,"deletions":0},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000340\u0000":{"address":{"type":"PULL","number":"340","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/340","comments":[],"reviews":[{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125749506","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"340","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"Summary:\r\nCloses #336.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nSnapshots updated; changes are easily readable.

We really want to keep\r\nthis setup: having the address types be structurally distinct is very\r\nnice. But currently the implementation is extremely repetitive. Core\r\nfunctionality is implemented twice, once for nodes and once for edges.\r\nThe test code is even worse, as it is forced to include ugly, hacky,\r\nparametric generalizations to test both implementations—which are really\r\nthe same code, anyway!\r\n\r\nIn this commit, we introduce a system to unify the _implementations_\r\nwhile keeping the _APIs_ separate. That is, users still see separate\r\nopaque types `NodeAddressT` and `EdgeAddressT`. Users now also see\r\nseparate modules `NodeAddress` and `EdgeAddress`, each of which\r\nimplements the same interface for its appropriate type. These modules\r\nare each implemented by the same address module factory.\r\n\r\nTo get this to work, we clearly need to parameterize the module type\r\nover the address type. The problem is getting this to work in a way that\r\ninteracts nicely with the opaque types. The trick is to let the factory\r\nalways return a transparent module at type `string`, but to then\r\nspecialize the type of the resulting module in the module in which the\r\nunderlying type of the opaque type is known.\r\n\r\nThis commit includes specifications for all functions that are in the\r\ncurrent version of the API, but includes only as much implementation\r\ncode as is needed to convince me that tests and Flow are actually\r\nrunning (i.e., very little).

This is powerful: it means that\r\nnot only do our tests for `Graph` test the graph, but also any tests\r\nthat depend on `Graph`—e.g., plugin code—will give us extra invariant\r\ntesting on `Graph`. As noted in a comment, if this becomes bad for\r\nperformance, we can blacklist expensive tests or whitelist tests that we\r\ncare about.\r\n\r\nA graph method may assume that the graph invariants hold before the\r\nmethod is invoked. Within the body of a graph method, invariants may be\r\nviolated, but the method must ensure that the invariants hold\r\nimmediately before it returns or yields. A consequence of this is that\r\nif a graph function internally calls a public function (e.g., `addEdge`\r\nmight call `hasNode` to check that the source and destination exist),\r\nthen it must ensure that the invariants hold before the internal call.\r\nThis is not an “implementation detail” or “caveat”; it is simply part of\r\nthe interface of public functions. It is legal and reasonable for\r\nprivate helper functions to explicitly not expect or not guarantee that\r\nparticular invariants hold, and in this case the exception should be\r\ndocumented. (This is not yet the case in any of our code.)\r\n\r\nFinally, note that the `checkInvariants` method should not call any\r\npublic methods, because those methods in turn call `checkInvariants`. If\r\nthis becomes a huge pain, we can look into implementing some kind of\r\n“only check invariants if the invariants are not actively being\r\nchecked”, but I’d much rather not do so if we don’t have to.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nRunning `yarn coverage` indicates that each of the failure cases is\r\nverified. In principle, I’d be willing to add a test that parses the\r\nsource code for `graph.js` and verifies that each `return`, `yield`, or\r\nimplicit return is preceded by an invariant check.

However,\r\nthis caused reference detection in strings like `\"#1 #2\"` to fail,\r\nbecause the putative matches would be `\"#1 \"` and `\" #2\"`, but these\r\nmatches overlap, and the JavaScript RegExp API (like most such APIs)\r\nfinds only non-overlapping matches. Therefore, in a string of\r\nspace-separated references of the same kind, only every other reference\r\nwould be detected.\r\n\r\nA solution is to use a positive lookahead instead of the second\r\nnon-capturing group: i.e., `/(?:\\W|$)/` becomes `/(?=\\W|$)/`.

This is a confusing UI, because it\r\nsuggests that any repository may be chosen, when in fact only repos\r\nalready loaded into the data store are available. The user is given no\r\nfeedback as to which repositories are valid options.\r\n\r\nAs of #516, the backend stores a registry listing available\r\nrepositories. This commit adds a `RepositorySelect` component which\r\nloads the available from that registry, and makes them available in a\r\ndropdown, in sorted order.\r\n\r\nWhen the user manually selects one of the repositories, that selection\r\nis persisted into localStorage and respected on future loads. If the\r\nuser hasn't made such a choice, then the first repository is selected by\r\ndefault.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is highly influenced by testability considerations.\r\nThe default export, `<RepositorySelect onChange={} localStore={} />`, is\r\npretty straightforward. The `RepositorySelect` is somewhat cumbersome to\r\ntest because it asynchronously fetches data and then updates its state,\r\nwhich affects the render output. So as to avoid testing inside async\r\nreact components wherever possible, I've factored out:\r\n\r\n* `loadStatus`, which uses fetch and localStore to get the status of the\r\nselector.\r\n* `PureRepositorySelect`, which just renders a `Status`, such as\r\nloading, failure, or valid\r\n* `LocalStoreRepositorySelect`, which wraps the `PureRepositorySelect`\r\nwith logic to bind the repository select to localStore on change.\r\n\r\nTest plan: Extensive unit tests were added. Also, to ensure that the\r\ntests were testing the right thing, I manually tested:\r\n- attempting to load invalid registry\r\n- attempting to load with no registry\r\n- attempting to load with empty registry\r\n- loading without valid localStore\r\n- changing the setting via dropdown\r\n- loading from localStore after changing the dropdown\r\n\r\nAnd all behavior was as expected.\r\n\r\nThanks to @wchargin for considerable help testing this PR.","title":"Convert Explorer repository selection to dropdown","mergedAs":{"type":"COMMIT","hash":"f110114833548253fd6a2e057bbee757af8d7d4c"},"additions":571,"deletions":54},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000530\u0000":{"address":{"type":"PULL","number":"530","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/530","comments":[{"type":"COMMENT","id":"408283912","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"530","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"reviews":[{"type":"REVIEW","id":"140960751","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"530","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"Test plan: Travis","title":"Fix a mistake in the implementation of #527","mergedAs":{"type":"COMMIT","hash":"e36a7c1af20ee23f1f9b448538991d44cd3328f0"},"additions":5,"deletions":5},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000531\u0000":{"address":{"type":"PULL","number":"531","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/531","comments":[{"type":"COMMENT","id":"408311565","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"531","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"reviews":[{"type":"REVIEW","id":"140980003","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"531","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},{"type":"REVIEW","id":"140980343","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"531","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},{"type":"REVIEW","id":"141172798","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"531","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},{"type":"REVIEW","id":"141195970","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"531","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},{"type":"REVIEW","id":"141196060","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"531","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},{"type":"REVIEW","id":"141196333","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"531","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}],"authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"In #529, I made the cred explorer populate a dropdown with the list of\r\nrepositories that are available to explore.

good overall, I have some suggestions on making the naming clearer.\r\n\r\nRegarding the canonicalization issue - I don't understand why the test script will require canonicalization going forward. The responsibility of the test script is to test that one piece we won't put into standard CI, which is hitting Github's live API with an API key. However, so long as the test script only compares the result of running fetchGithubRepo in the past to the result of running fetchGithubRepo at present (i.e. it is basically a manually-implemented snapshot test), the canonicalization in fetchGithubRepo is sufficient. The data source that doesn't canonicalize (manually running curl against the API using the new query) isn't expected to be part of the future test plan, so there isn't a need to accomodate it in the script; your having checked in the output query in snapshot form is sufficient. No?\r\n\r\nThat said, there's basically no cost to putting canonicalization back in the test script, so you're free to do that if you wish.\r\n","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}]},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000078\u0000104662093\u0000":{"address":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"104662093","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"78","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/78#pullrequestreview-104662093","state":"APPROVED","comments":[],"body":"","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}]},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000079\u0000104758230\u0000":{"address":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"104758230","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"79","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/79#pullrequestreview-104758230","state":"APPROVED","comments":[],"body":"nice tests.","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}]},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000080\u0000104758239\u0000":{"address":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"104758239","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"80","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/80#pullrequestreview-104758239","state":"APPROVED","comments":[],"body":"This looks distantly familiar! :-)","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}]},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000081\u0000104758999\u0000":{"address":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"104758999","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"81","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/81#pullrequestreview-104758999","state":"COMMENTED","comments":[],"body":"First-pass comments in https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/81#issuecomment-373899511.","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}]},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000081\u0000105101229\u0000":{"address":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"105101229","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"81","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/81#pullrequestreview-105101229","state":"APPROVED","comments":[{"type":"COMMENT","id":"175553358","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"105101229","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"81","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},{"type":"COMMENT","id":"175556290","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"105101229","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"81","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}}],"body":"Looks good.

I love red diffs!\r\n 2. Changes to numeric and username references look great. However,\r\n    you’re losing functionality with the URL references: the function\r\n    used to provide structured results, but now provides only ugly\r\n    strings. This is a symptom of a bigger problem, explained below.\r\n 3. Usually, I’d nag to put the username reference detection in a\r\n    separate PR, but the red diff put me in a good mood. :-)\r\n\r\nAn immediate fix to avoid losing the structured form of URL references\r\nis to do the following. Expose an additional function\r\n`parseGithubUrlReference` that takes a string that is already expected\r\nto match the regex exactly (i.e., to be an element of a result of\r\n`findGithubUrlReferences`) and projects out the relevant structured\r\nform. (Doing this now makes sense to me, because it enables you to\r\npreserve the detailed test coverage.)\r\n\r\nThe bigger problem is that you actually want the structured form for\r\n_all_ reference kinds. Otherwise, you’ll see client code like:\r\n```js\r\nfindNumericReferences(body).map((x) => {\r\n  const actualNumber = +(x.substr(\"#\".length));\r\n});\r\nfindUsernameReferences(body).map((x) => {\r\n  const actualLogin = x.substr(\"@\".length);\r\n});\r\n```\r\nwhich is ugly at best, and arguably breaks the module encapsulation.\r\n\r\nSo we could have a function `parseReference`, like\r\n`parseGithubUrlReference` above, that extracts the relevant parts of any\r\nreference!\r\n\r\nBut there are two downsides to this. First: we’re using an unnecessary\r\nand limiting intermediate string format. If a reference is\r\ncontext-sensitive then we may not be able to infer all relevant\r\ninformation from the reference itself—consider `Fixes #123`. Second: why\r\nfind the references with structure, throw away the structure, and then\r\nreconstruct it? It seems wasteful and confusing…\r\n\r\n…so this leads us to suspect that perhaps the best solution is for the\r\ncode to just do the right thing from the start. Let `findAllReferences`\r\nreturn a `Reference[]`, where we have types like the following:\r\n```js\r\nexport type NumericReference = {|\r\n  +type: \"NUMERIC\",\r\n  +raw: string,\r\n  +number: number,\r\n|};\r\nexport type UsernameReference = {|\r\n  +type: \"USERNAME\",\r\n  +raw: string,\r\n  +login: string,\r\n|};\r\nexport type IssueReference = {|\r\n  +type: \"ISSUE\",\r\n  +raw: string,\r\n  +repoName: string,\r\n  +repoOwner: string,\r\n  // no `parentType` needed!\r\n  +number: number,\r\n|};\r\n// more, e.g.:\r\nexport type PullRequestReviewCommentReference = {|\r\n  +type: \"PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW_COMMENT\",\r\n  +raw: string,\r\n  +repoName: string,\r\n  +repoOwner: string,\r\n  +number: number,\r\n  +fragmentNumber: number,\r\n|};\r\nexport type Reference = | ...;\r\n```\r\nThen, `findAllReferences` can be the unique export, which is a sign that\r\nwe have a Good API.\r\n\r\nNow, clients can look at the raw form—for printing, maybe, or using as\r\nan ID—and also have access to all the relevant structure.\r\n\r\nWhat do you

given an offline discussion. Here is a summary of that discussion:\r\n\r\nPoint (in favor): If an external plugin wants to interface with the GitHub graph—say, create an edge from a GitHub user node to some FooPlugin node—then it will need to construct the appropriate ID, and it would be nice if it didn’t have to query a GitHub API to do so. Transparent IDs are helpful in this case.\r\n\r\nCounterpoint: The most salient point (in my opinion) of the preceding statement is that external consumers need to have a way to construct IDs. It seems clear that this should be functionality provided by the GitHub plugin—something like `declare function userNodeAddress(login: string): Address`—and not just expecting clients to do string interpolation or something. This gives us more flexibility: the format is still opaque to clients, but clients have ways to work with these opaque formats.\r\n\r\nPoint (in favor): URLs are already part of GitHub’s contract. If GitHub changes the issue URLs to something else, the web breaks, and so GitHub is incentivized not to do that.\r\n\r\nCounterpoint: True, but they could (and would) just add 301s and make the change anyway, so this doesn’t actually stop them from changing the URL format.\r\n\r\nRelated observation: It looks like GitHub’s GraphQL IDs are guaranteed to be stable; the [`ID` documentation][id] mentions that an ID is “often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache”; neither of these operations makes sense unless the ID is stable.\r\n\r\n[id]: https://developer.github.com/v4/scalar/id/\r\n\r\nPoint (against): Making fundamental API decisions based on snapshot test legibility is clearly questionable.\r\n\r\nCounterpoint: True, but legibility in general _is_ an important criterion, and snapshot test legibility is perhaps a good indicator of overall legibility.\r\n\r\nPoint (in favor): Our whole addressing API will almost certainly be overhauled due to things that we’ve learned since its creation. For instance, the address–payload distinction is very clunky, and we are looking into ways to improve it. So there’s not too much harm in making a decision now that we might reverse later.\r\n\r\nConclusions: We agree that the opaque-IDs-with-exposed-operations is a good paradigm.

the client API, as used in the test code, looks very nice and clean.\r\n\r\nSecond: I appreciate that the `Post` and `Commentable` types are private and not exported.

Unfortunately, it doesn't work out of the box (I had `...it(\"doesn't work\", () => { expect(1).to.equal(2) }` passing). \r\n\r\nBasically, it expects a mocha/chai environment, and just doesn't seem to interact that well with jest. I spent a little time unsuccessfully trying to get a minimal example that I could share with the author, will maybe put some more work into that.

want to take a look: oclif-test uses [fancy-test] as a utility library for wrapping the oclif commands. fancy-test is also written by the author of oclif and oclif represents substantively all of its usage. the fancy-test docs suggest that it hasn't been tested with jest but the author is open to getting it to work, so producing a minimal failing fancy-{j}est example would be be a good next

see three primary problems, which have a common solution.\r\n\r\nFirst: The `T & Compatible` type has some alarming implications, I'm afraid. Suppose that `T` is `{| +color: string |}`. Then `T & Compatible` is uninhabited: any value that has type `Compatible` must have a `__compat__` attribute, but `T` is exact and must not have that attribute, so no value can have both type `T` and type `Compatible`. Surely we do not want to prohibit callers from using exact types `T`.\r\n\r\nSecond: The restriction that only non-`null` object types may be processed by this module is, in my opinion, highly understandabad. The whole point of this module is to allow separating the logical value of a datum from its internal representation; further restricting the internal representation seems counterproductive. We have recently seen that such restrictions can be frustrating, as with `WeakMap`'s object-only key requirement.\r\n\r\nThird: While is not obviously absurd to reserve an object attribute (`__compat__`) and require that clients omit this field, doing so has some negative implications. Suppose that the `Graph` class uses this versioning module. Suppose also that the Git porcelain’s `GraphPorcelain` wants to use this versioning module. The `GraphPorcelain` simply wraps a `Graph`, so its natural serialized form is simply the serialized form of the graph. But the serialized form of a `Graph` will have a `__compat__` field! This example reveals that the restriction is actually a major problem: it means that clients have to be aware of the serialized forms of their elements, which breaks encapsulation.\r\n\r\nHere is a solution that fixes all of the above problems. What do you think about using `[CompatInfo, T]` as the at-rest type instead, where `type CompatInfo = {| +type: string, +version: string |}`? An alternative would be `{| +__compat__: CompatInfo, +value: T |}`, which is arguably more readable but does take up slightly more space on disk.","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}]},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000292\u0000121879121\u0000":{"address":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"121879121","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"292","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/292#pullrequestreview-121879121","state":"COMMENTED","comments":[{"type":"COMMENT","id":"189657055","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"121879121","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"292","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},{"type":"COMMENT","id":"189657399","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"121879121","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"292","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},{"type":"COMMENT","id":"189657549","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"121879121","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"292","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},{"type":"COMMENT","id":"189660876","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"121879121","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"292","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},{"type":"COMMENT","id":"189661489","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"121879121","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"292","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},{"type":"COMMENT","id":"189661954","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"121879121","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"292","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},{"type":"COMMENT","id":"189662327","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"121879121","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"292","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},{"type":"COMMENT","id":"189662758","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"121879121","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"292","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},{"type":"COMMENT","id":"189663017","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"121879121","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"292","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}}],"body":"Nice tests.

My inline comments gesture at my larger belief that attempting to de-privilege type is misguided; it serves a vital function, as evidenced by the fact that it's been independently created in two consonant contexts (node type and compat type), and is used throughout the codebase and even in your examples for what a non-privileged type world would look like. It's actually the `address`, specifically `address.id`, that should be de-privileged; plugins should be able to make their own choices about which pieces of information are sufficient to ID the payload. Here is a sketch of what I think should happen with type:\r\n\r\n- Types should be treated as opaque by callers, i.e. they do not get to directly look at something's type and do string comparison. Instead, they use a functional interface. This interface will enable caching and deduplication, i.e. the graph uses an integer type representation under the hood and in serialization.\r\n- It should be legal to check just the pluginName property on a type, but illegal to check just the \"type\". This eliminates a class of bug where you want `sourcecred/sourcecred/github/issue` but accidentally get `foo/bar/gitlab/issue` and your code breaks.\r\n- Types should be unified across the `CompatInfo` and the node types. We should also come up with a spec on type namespacing (e.g. sourcecred/github-beta is clearly inferior to sourcecred/sourcecred/github@v0.1.0). If we unify compatinfo with type, that implies that node types get versioning, which seems clearly desirable.\r\n\r\nMy other nit: as you know, I appreciate concision in regularly-referenced concepts and names. `node.ref` is nice and concise; `node.payload` not so much.

(This is what I was trying to suggest near the end; perhaps\r\nI wasn’t clear enough.)\r\n\r\n> Here is a sketch of what I think should happen with type: […]\r\n\r\nAfter reading this list, I feel like I’m missing a piece of the picture\r\nas you see it. I suspect that we’ll be able to communicate better in\r\nperson, and can then serialize thoughts back to this PR or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n> Can we find a 3 or 4 character alias for `payload`? `node.data`,\r\n> `node.own` (as in own data), ...?\r\n\r\nThe name `data`, as in `node.ref` and `node.data`, is fine with me in\r\nprinciple. Are you suggesting that we change the core interfaces to\r\n`NodeReference` and `NodeData`? It might be confusing to have\r\n`node.data` give a `NodePayload`.\r\n\r\nBy the way: the Rust team [used to have][rust] a rule that no keywords\r\nmay have more than five letters. (Some Rust keywords include `fn`,\r\n`mut`, `impl`, `trait`, and `pub`, all of which are used reasonably\r\nfrequently.) Rust now has some longer keywords: `fmt` became `format`,\r\nfor instance. I’d be interested to hear what motivated the change, if\r\nthere was any formal discussion of it.\r\n\r\nAnd, just to put my point of view in the bikeshed: I greatly appreciate\r\n_cognitive_ concision, and only weakly appreciate _orthographic_\r\nconcision. To me, `node.payload` and `node.data` are basically the same,\r\nin the same sense that `yellow` is not actually any more complicated\r\nthan `red`. (Consequently, I’m happy to use `data` if it makes you\r\nhappier). The time to type three marginal letters simply doesn’t matter.\r\n\r\n[rust]: http://words.steveklabnik.com/four-years-with-rust\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn the whole: it seems to me that most of the ongoing discussion relates\r\nto things that are not on the critical path of this change.

have some questions, a couple of suggestions.\r\n\r\nWhy is `address.js` this kind of pseudo-private module that shouldn’t be\r\ndirectly imported by clients? It could just expose:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndeclare module \"address\" {\r\n  declare opaque type NodeAddress;\r\n  declare opaque type EdgeAddress;\r\n  declare function nodeAddress(parts: $ReadOnlyArray<string>): NodeAddress;\r\n  declare function edgeAddress(parts: $ReadOnlyArray<string>): EdgeAddress;\r\n  declare function toParts(address: NodeAddress | EdgeAddress): string[];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want the assertion functions to be visible for test code only,\r\nor test code and `graph.js`, you can just underscore-name them. (Though\r\nI don’t see a problem with the assertions being part of the public\r\nAPI—I’m happy to include them or exclude them, as you prefer.)\r\n\r\nWhat’s with all the underscore-names in `address.js`? (Are you trying to\r\nget around “cannot declare `NodeAddress` because the name is already\r\nbound” or something? If so, just `export`-`from`, or `import` with an\r\nalias.)\r\n\r\nWhy export an object `_Address` containing functions? This is unsafe\r\n(callers may freely and typesafely modify the attributes on the object)\r\nand annoying (callers can no longer import individual values). If you\r\nexport values individually, callers can either import them individually\r\nor `import * as Address from \"./address\"` (which _is_ safe).\r\n\r\nIf you want to re-export the members of `address.js` from `graph.js`,\r\nthat’s probably fine with me (depending on how you do it).\r\n\r\nIt seems desirable that `NodeAddress` and `EdgeAddress` should be\r\n[declared as opaque subtypes][1] of `string`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport opaque type NodeAddress: string = string;\r\nexport opaque type EdgeAddress: string = string;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis enables other modules to safely reason about reference semantics\r\n(i.e., that `(===)` coincides with logical equality), and therefore use\r\nthese in `Set`s and `Map`s, don’t have to worry about defensively\r\ncopying them, etc. Clients still won’t be able to obtain them from\r\nstrings: if `a1` and `a2` are addresses, then `a1 + a2` is _not_ an\r\naddress (which is good).\r\n\r\n[1]: https://flow.org/en/docs/types/opaque-types/#toc-subtyping-constraints\r\n\r\nI’m not dead-set against using union types in public APIs for things\r\nlike `toParts` and `concat`. However, I thoroughly disagree that this is\r\n“simpler”—one function that has a bounded wildcard with an upper bound\r\nof a union type is clearly more complicated than two monomorphic\r\nfunctions with simple domain and codomain. Is there an advantage here\r\nbesides implementation laziness (no offense)? That is, under what\r\ncircumstances is there a value whose type is known to be “either\r\n`NodeAddress` or `EdgeAddress`, but we’re not sure which one”? This\r\ncan’t be a very useful type for callers, because it is incompatible with\r\nevery method on `Graph` (you can’t `addNode` or `hasEdge` or anything,\r\nand with good reason). I’m feeling very “when in doubt, leave it out”.\r\n\r\nWhy allow `nodeAddress` and `edgeAddress` to be called with `undefined`?\r\nThis seems like a great way to mask bugs: if a client passes `undefined`\r\ninstead of an array, it seems at least as likely that the client has a\r\nbug causing their intended-array to be `undefined` than that they\r\nactually want the address given by `[]`. If a client does want this\r\nsemantics, they can just write `myArrayOrUndefined || []`.\r\n\r\nThe following two tests would have passed in the previous API, but fail\r\nunder the code in this pull request:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndescribe(\"toParts\", () => {\r\n  it(\"throws on fake (slash-separated) node address\", () => {\r\n    // $ExpectFlowError\r\n    expect(() => toParts(\"N/bad/stuff\\0\")).toThrow();\r\n  });\r\n  it(\"throws on fake (slash-separated) edge address\", () => {\r\n    // $ExpectFlowError\r\n    expect(() => toParts(\"E/bad/stuff\\0\")).toThrow();\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this intentional? If so, why?\r\n\r\nNote that `typeof NODE | typeof EDGE` is just `Symbol`; there is no\r\nadditional safety granted by using that definition.\r\n\r\nI like the tests that node and edge addresses are distinct at both the\r\ntype layer and the value layer.\r\n","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}]},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000334\u0000125703590\u0000":{"address":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125703590","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"334","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/334#pullrequestreview-125703590","state":"APPROVED","comments":[],"body":"","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}]},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000335\u0000125721219\u0000":{"address":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125721219","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"335","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/335#pullrequestreview-125721219","state":"APPROVED","comments":[{"type":"COMMENT","id":"192862766","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125721219","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"335","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}}],"body":"Sounds good;

Here are my thoughts.\r\n\r\nOf the two, `simple-git` (known on GitHub as `steveukx/git-js`) is certainly simpler. It provides a JS veneer over standard Git APIs. But I think that it may be too simple. Most of its commands seem to be wrappers around the actual `git(1)` CLI, whose output is parsed by `simple-git`. But this parsing is flaky—e.g., `repo.log(['--stat'])` silently gives completely wrong output, and `repo.log(['--follow', filename])` has the same issue that `gitpython` does with renames (creating “filenames” like `\"file => file2\"`).\r\n\r\nWe might have to consider coming back to `simple-git`, but it’s not my top choice. Combine the fact that it will spawn a ton of subprocesses (not great) with the fact that it doesn’t even do a great job of parsing the output, and I don’t see a compelling reason to use it.\r\n\r\nNow, `nodegit` takes a different approach. It exposes direct bindings to `libgit2`, and in fact is the official set of JS bindings for this standard library (as seen on [the `libgit2` homepage][libgit2]). This suggests to me that it should theoretically have better support. In my opinion, the library has two major downsides. First, while the documentation serves as a useful skeleton for the type hierarchies and structures, its explanatory value is next to nothing. For instance, [here’s the page for `Revwalk`][nodegit-revwalk]. I can gather that it’s supposed to walk over revisions, and I can see what _types_ of arguments I’m supposed to pass to the `push*` family of functions—but I have no idea what they actually do. (Why does a file walker need a stack?) The `hide` options are even more confusing.\r\n\r\nThat said, the failures of the documentation are partially mitigated by the fact that `nodegit`’s architecture very closely mirrors that of `libgit2` itself, and `libgit2`’s documentation is far better. The [`libgit2` documentation for `git_revwalk_push`][libgit2-revwalk-push] answers all my questions in plain English. (Believe it or not, it was easier for me to write a working program using `libgit2` in C than the same program using `nodegit` in JS, given that I did the latter first.)\r\n\r\nThe other problem that I have with `nodegit` is that… well, I’ve just had an unusual of trouble getting simple examples working. Things like, their docs say that a callback is called with `(null, null)` when iteration finishes, but it’s actually called with `(someErrorObject, undefined)`. I even managed to get a ten-line program, basically copied from their examples, to throw a `SIGABRT` (134) and hard-crash all of node ([issue details])—this worries me a bit.\r\n\r\nIn summary: I really want to like `nodegit`, but I’m not sure that it’s the right choice, either. Maybe parsing the output of `git(1)` CLI commands really is simpler.

Fork nodegit, fork simplegit, or roll our own?\r\n\r\nI think that before we attempt to answer this question, we should nail down exactly what it is that we want from git: for instance, come up with a formal spec for the functions that we’re trying to implement, and worry about implementing them later. There are a couple of points in particular that I think we have not fully explored:\r\n\r\n 1. After the allocation, which values are going to be persisted as part of a permanent (but evolving) datastore, as opposed to solely being used transiently in the initial construction process?\r\n 2. How will later allocations build incrementally on the work from the original allocation?\r\n 3. What do we do with merge commits (and nonlinear histories in general)?\r\n\r\nPerhaps surprisingly, I think that (3) is the most important question—it’s not just an implementation detail; rather, it informs the answers to the previous two questions, and in fact restricts the sets of possible answers. (Part of this has to do with git’s internal object model, and part of it stems from loose interpretations of terms like “file”.) It may be easiest to discuss this in person.\r\n\r\nOnce we’ve answered these questions, let’s build a rough, but fully functional, implementation using whatever tools are easiest.

Each project would issue its own cred, which would be a distinct exchangeable cryptoasset; within this view, it made sense to start with a top-down view that begins at the project root and progresses down to subprojects, and then directly to contributions. \r\n\r\nNow, I'm thinking of SourceCred as more of a \"web-of-contributions\", in which the underlying data structure is just a directed graph. There are three kinds of nodes: *projects*, *contributions*, and *identities*. \r\n\r\nA *project* is an attempt to make an easy entry point for recognizing the value provided by a set of contributions. It has directed edges (or, transitively, paths) to all of the contributions that compose the project. For example, I expect `SourceCred`, `SourceCred/explorer`, and `SourceCred/explorer/infrastructure` to all be projects. `/infrastructure` would have edges to the PRs that set up frontend infrastructure, like #22 and #27. `explorer/` would have edges to `explorer/infrastructure`, and so forth. \r\n\r\nA *contribution* is something that adds value to the project. It's a deliberately broad concept; in the case of SourceCred, I expect pull requests, issues, issue comments, Git commits, and giving talks could all be contributions. Contributions have edges to things they depend on. For example, let's consider #27. I imagine it having edges to:\r\n- The two PRs that it directly references, which are the actual bugfixes we want merged\r\n- @wchargin, for merging the PR\r\n- @dandelionmane, for reviewing and merging the PR\r\n- the SourceCred/infrastructure project, since it builds on the rest of the infrastructure in the SC frontend, and wouldn't have any value absent that context\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of those edges, it will likely also have paths to:\r\n- babel-plugin-flow-react, because it points to two PRs in that project\r\n- flow, via babel-plugin-flow-react\r\n- react, as above\r\n- babel, as above\r\n- itself, via SourceCred/infrastructure (cycles will be *very* common)\r\n\r\nAlso, I think SourceCred/infrastructure should point to SourceCred/ root, because SourceCred frontend infrastructure derives its value from being useful to SourceCred as a whole, and if someone else e.g. makes a massive contribution to the SourceCred backend infrastructure, it makes the SC frontend infra more valuable as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think another path from #27 to SC/root would be via the PRs in babel-plugin-flow-react, e.g. https://github.com/brigand/babel-plugin-flow-react-proptypes/pull/182. That PR, which provides value to b-p-f-r, exists because the SourceCred project decided to use b-p-f-r, and people primarily focused on SC went and fixed it for them. So I think there's a real sense in which the SC project (or maybe more immediately: sc/explorer/infra) has contributed value to babel-plugin-flow-react.\r\n\r\nMoving on: an *identity* is an agent or actor that deserves cred for contributing value. Identities can have edges to other identities, projects, and contributions; for example, it might make sense to create a \"team identity\" that has edges to the members of the team; this might be a good way to capture the value of e.g. managers, who don't directly create many recognizable contributions but let a group of people work more effectively. Also, identities may want to recognize that they derive value from other projects; for example, if I use Ubuntu and XMonad, I may want to flow value to those two projects.\r\n\r\n(Aside: I think in the future we'll want \"scoped identities\" that are scoped to projects or other contexts. Hypothetically, when I make a contribution to sc/explorer/infra, by default I want to flow value to a vim-react plugin, but when I make a contribution to sc/design/incentives, I want to flow value to the authors of an open-source game theory textbook. These are future considerations.)\r\n\r\nThis graph gets weird in a recursive way when you consider that the graph, itself, is a contribution. For example, if I do a bunch of housekeeping work on the SourceCred/Explorer project (e.g. I discover a lot of important contributions that weren't acknowledged by the project, but according to our practices on maintaining the top level projects, they should have been), then that modification to the cred graph is itself a contribution that merits some cred. I'm not sure how to model that, exactly.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Does this seem like a good semantic fit for the task of attributing credit to projects? Do you agree with the examples in the case of SourceCred?

I.e. \r\n\r\n`C :: Set(Node) -> Set(Node) -> Number`\r\n\r\nI think `C` should have the following properties:\r\n- The amount of cred attributed to a set of contributions should be the sum of the cred attributed to the contributions within that set, after accounting for duplication.

For instance, if your types are inexact, then Flow won’t complain if you try to use an edge as a node.\r\n\r\nIf we want to recognize that careful valuations are themselves valuable, then it kind of makes sense to be able to flow value to a valuation: i.e., have an edge to an edge.\r\n\r\nIf edges are nodes, then the types can be unified to something like\r\n```js\r\nexport type Entity<T> = {|\r\n  +address: Address,\r\n  +payload: T,\r\n  +hom: ?{| +src: Address, +dst: Address |},\r\n|};\r\n```\r\nwhere the `src` and `dst` addresses are for any entity.\r\n\r\nThis also suggests that the address space should be unified, which is something that we had been wondering about previously.\r\n\r\nIf edges are nodes, then it’s not clear how standard graph algorithms work. But there is a “splicing” translation from ω-graphs (← good name for the “edges are nodes” data structure) to graphs, something like the following: if an edge `e : a → b` has an incident 2-edge `f : u → e`, then make a new node `•`, replace the edge `e` with edges `e_1 : a → •` and `e_2 : • → b`, and change the edge `f` to be `f : u → •`.

The motivation for making edges nodes is that it provides a seemingly principled solution to the meta-valuation problem. However, as @wchargin's discussion demonstrates, it also adds a lot of complexity to our underlying data structure. Also, when you look at the semantics closely, valuing edges rarely seems like the right thing to do. Most edges are programmatically generated by some tool, e.g. the GitHub plugin automatically generates edges that represent comment authorship or cross-reference. Rewarding the individual edge that effects cross-reference seems like a very indirect way to approach meta-valuation, since really we should be rewarding contributions to the tool that generated those edges.\r\n\r\nIn #41 I describe an \"artifact\" plugin that creates nodes that represent curated allocations of value to pieces and processes that compose a project. The each artifact has a meta-artifact which values the work of maintaining the artifact. I believe that artifacts and meta-artifacts make significant progress towards solving meta-valuation:\r\n\r\n- For valuing auto-generated edges, the project itself should value artifact that auto-generates those edges. For example, if SourceCred values the GitHub value network, it should flow some Cred to the artifacts that maintain that network. (Precise semantics still need clarification).\r\n\r\nMy belief is that the artifact system, or followon developments, will allow us to solve the meta-valuation problem without needing to make every edge into a node.

We had an offline discussion about how we want to set up our `Node` type: do we want to express subtyping by saying `Node`s have a payload with subtype, or `Node`s are extended to the subtype? I.e.:\r\n\r\nPayload Approach:\r\n```ts\r\ntype Node<T> {\r\n  address: Address,\r\n  payload: T,\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype IssuePayload {\r\n  title: string,\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype IssueNode = Node<IssuePayload>\r\n```\r\n\r\nExtension Approach:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype Node {\r\n  address: Address,\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype IssueNode extends Node {\r\n  title: string,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe decided to go with the payload approach; both because it's considered best practice to prefer composition over inheritance, and because it creates a data structure that explicitly reflects how our data is composed (ie: everything from plugin is under payload/, rather than plugin data is mixed in at the same level).\r\n\r\nHowever, when you consider the Edge type:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype Edge<T> {\r\n  address: Address,\r\n  src: Address,\r\n  dst: Address,\r\n  payload: T,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt starts to look like both Edge and Node are implicitly inheriting from an undeclared base type Addressable:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype Addressable {\r\n  address: Address,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile writing test code, we've actually reified the Addressable type a few times, which suggests that it's a useful concept. \r\n\r\nWould it be useful to factor out `Addressable`s as a payload-bearing-type like we did with `Node` and `Edge`?

What happens to `src` and `dst`? You could put them into the payload, so that\r\n```js\r\ntype Edge<T> = Addressable<{| +src: Address, +dst: Address, +realPayload: T |}>\r\n```\r\nbut that’s quite ugly, IMO: `edge.payload.realPayload` is ungainly, and `edge.payload.src` doesn’t make sense. Semantically, `src` and `dst` are _not_ part of the payload of the edge. They are metadata, like the address. But if we put them at top level, then `Edge<T>` adds additional properties onto `Addressable<T>`. This is weird, because the structure of this version of `Addressable<T>` strongly suggests that an object `x: Addressable<T>` is determined only by its `address` and its `payload`. For instance, given this interface, I would feel comfortable writing an equality function:\r\n```js\r\nfunction equals<T>(x: Addressable<T>, y: Addressable<T>) {\r\n  return deepEqual(x.address, y.address) && deepEqual(x.payload, y.payload);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich would fail on edges.\r\n\r\nI also don’t really see any advantage to including the payload in the `Addressable` interface, so I think that the simple `interface Addressable { +address: Address; }` is the way to go.\r\n\r\nYou also propose an alternate interface where the `Addressable`’s key is an arbitrary `JSONSerializable`.

I think that it forces a lot more serialization and deserialization than is really necessary. Any time that we need to refer to an address opaquely, we’ll have to serialize and deserialize the plugin-specific `id`—which may be arbitrarily large. For instance, a breadth-first search requires at least one roundtrip serialization for each node in the connected component of the source (and with our APIs we’re looking at two or three). If `Address` has `id: string`, then no such computation is performed: a plugin only parses IDs when their contents are relevant.\r\n\r\nUsing `id: string` of course _allows_ plugins to serialize the data from JSON themselves, but does not require them to. Using `id: JSONSerializable` would be convenient for the standard use case, and promote good defaults, but it _may_ be the case that it precludes efficient implementations.\r\n\r\nNote that this is compatible with your other suggestion that “we can use the JSON serialization of the Address as the object keys, and elide them from the Addressables. (And on deserialization we put them back.)”\r\n\r\nWe’ve spent a bunch of time talking about this, so here’s what I suggest: I’ll implement an address map against this spec, just so that we have something to work from, and then we can remain open to changing it later—either in response to perf requirements or because we decide that another approach is semantically better.

The queries have a small API surface area, so it should be easy enough to make sure that the (actual) types are kept in sync with any changes. In the long term, static typing would be great.

We could make it type-aware with a moderate amount of effort. We could then modify it to print Flow type signatures as strings, but I'm not aware of any way to actually integrate those type signatures into the rest of our code, so we'd have to build some tooling around it. All in all, it probably isn't conceptually hard, but I would expect it to take a few days to get right, and I'm just not convinced that it's worth it right now.\r\n\r\n> How about we use the fact that GraphQL schemas are introspective, and generate the typesig by talking to the actual prod server and getting the schema?

We might\r\nreceive the following results:\r\n```js\r\nconst r1 = {\r\n  repository: {\r\n    issues: {\r\n      pageInfo: {hasMorePages: true},\r\n      nodes: [/* issue #1 */],\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\nconst r2 = {\r\n  _n7: {\r\n    issues: {\r\n      pageInfo: {hasMorePages: true},\r\n      nodes: [/* issue #2 */],\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\nconst r3 = {\r\n  _n3: {\r\n    issues: {\r\n      pageInfo: {hasMorePages: false},\r\n      nodes: [/* issue #3 */],\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe need to combine these. We have two options: we could combine `r1` and\r\n`r2` to form\r\n```js\r\nconst r12 = {\r\n  repository: {\r\n    issues: {\r\n      pageInfo: {hasMorePages: true},\r\n      nodes: [/* issue #1 */, /* issue #2 */],\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\nand then merge `r3` into this to form our final result, or we could\r\nstart by combining `r2` and `r3` thus:\r\n```js\r\nconst r23 = {\r\n  _n7: {\r\n    issues: {\r\n      pageInfo: {hasMorePages: true},\r\n      nodes: [/* issue #2 */, /* issue #3 */],\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can roughly be seen as varying the associativity of the merge\r\noperation: the former option has left-associative merge, and the latter\r\noperator right-associative merge.\r\n\r\nThe left-associative merge has the advantage that at each step the\r\nresult is a sensible response to the original query that becomes\r\nincrementally more complete. This makes it easier to gradually display\r\nmore information in a UI, or to pick up where we left off if we are\r\ninterrupted. The right-associative merge is more computationally\r\nefficient, because we are always operating on small structures until the\r\nvery end, instead of operating on a megastructure at each step.\r\n\r\nWhich strategy is used is an implementation detail, so there’s nothing\r\npressing here, but we should keep an eye on it. Currently, we use a\r\nvariant of the left-associative merge. In fact, our process is to\r\ngenerate `r12` and analyze _it_ for continuations to form the query that\r\nyields `r3`, instead of getting these directly from `r2`. This is\r\nespecially computationally wasteful, so improving this (while keeping\r\nthe merge left-associative) should be our first step if client-side\r\nperformance becomes an issue.\r\n\r\n## Typing for queries and results\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting one. In [a comment][comment-flow-types] on #76,\r\n@decentralion proposed that we generate Flow types for the _results_ of\r\nGraphQL queries. If we had had this infrastructure when I was writing\r\nthe specific implementation, then a few mistakes that I made would have\r\nbeen mitigated. Others, that could be caught in principle, would not:\r\nfor instance, at one point I declared something like\r\n```js\r\nconst subpath = [...path, \"issues\", i];\r\n```\r\nwhere I should have written\r\n```js\r\nconst subpath = [...path, \"issues\", \"nodes\", i];\r\n```\r\nbut it is not possible\\* to express the semantics of the logical type of\r\n`path` in a Flow type (e.g., that `result.issues.nodes[i]` should be\r\ndefined in the above example).\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe that these benefits would be mostly lost if we moved\r\nto the more general API (still GitHub-specific, but not query-specific).\r\nAlso, I think that the marginal value of these types _once the\r\npagination API is already written_ (and never changed again or\r\nrefactored, of course! :-) ) is small. The top-level API’s types are\r\nvery simple and do not depend on any particular schema types. Therefore,\r\nmy conclusion is that my needle on whether we should add GraphQL result\r\ntypes hasn’t actually moved much at all as a result of performing this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\\* Certainly not possible without tricky tricks. I’ve played around with\r\nit and don’t think that it’s possible at all with these value types.\r\nMaybe some contortions would be able to force it, but I suspect that it\r\nwould not be worth the trouble.\r\n\r\n[comment-flow-types]: https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/76#issuecomment-373613940\r\n\r\n## Relay Cursor Connections Specification\r\n\r\nGitHub’s GraphQL API implements the [Relay Cursor Connections\r\nSpecification][spec]. It would therefore be feasible to write our more\r\ngeneral pagination API against this spec, so that it could be more\r\neasily applicable to other projects. There’s one catch: GitHub provides\r\nsome syntactic sugar that is not required by the spec, but which we use\r\nextensively. In particular:\r\n\r\n  - The `nodes` fields on connections are not required; only the `edges`\r\n    fields are. Of course, `nodes { … }` can always be replaced with\r\n    `edges { node { … } }`, but this changes the structure of the output\r\n    by introducing an additional level of nesting.\r\n\r\n  - The `PageInfo` type is not required to expose `endCursor` and\r\n    `startCursor`; instead, cursor are provided via `edges { cursor }`.\r\n    Here, `data.pageInfo.endCursor` is approximately equivalent to\r\n    `data.edges[data.edges.length - 1].cursor`, modulo error handling.\r\n\r\nThis presents the following options.\r\n\r\n  - Write the pagination API against an extension of the GraphQL spec\r\n    that also requires these extensions. (Before selecting this, it\r\n    would be a good idea to find other implementors of the Relay spec\r\n    and see if they provide a similar affordance. The [examples] in\r\n    the Relay docs have `endCursor` but not `nodes`, for instance.)\r\n\r\n  - Write the pagination API against the vanilla Relay spec, and change\r\n    our data format accordingly. This would cause a bit of bloat in the\r\n    output data, but probably not significantly.\r\n\r\n  - Write some kind of hybrid that fetches according to the spec but\r\n    then transforms the data into our currently-expected format. (This\r\n    doesn’t seem like a good idea to me.)\r\n\r\n[spec]: https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm\r\n[examples]: https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/en/graphql-server-specification.html#schema\r\n\r\n## Long-term plan\r\n\r\nThis whole module is predicated on the assumption that recursively\r\nfetching the whole repository is the right thing to do. This scales well\r\nto small, medium, and even large-ish projects, but not to the outliers:\r\nfor instance, torvalds/linux has 750,000 commits. Eventually, we’ll need\r\nto make sure to use online algorithms everywhere. But that’s a task for\r\nanother time.\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000117\u0000379634273\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"379634273","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"117","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/117#issuecomment-379634273","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"I’m closing this issue for now.

First is `NodePayload`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ninterface NodePayload {\r\n  address(): Address;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlugins are expected to have a variety of subclasses of `NodePayload`,\r\none for each logical type. These classes can provide domain-specific\r\nporcelain. For instance, the GitHub plugin might have:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntype GithubNodeType = \"PULL_REQUEST\" | \"PULL_REQUEST_COMMENT\";  // e.g.\r\nclass GithubNodePayload<+T: {+url: string}> implements NodePayload {\r\n  +record: T;\r\n  +_type: GithubNodeType;\r\n  constructor(record: T, type: GithubNodeType) {\r\n    this.record = record;\r\n    this._type = type;\r\n  }\r\n  address() {\r\n    return {\r\n      pluginName: \"sourcecred/github-beta\",\r\n      type: this._type,\r\n      id: this.url(),\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n  url() {\r\n    return this.record.url;\r\n  }\r\n  toJSON() { throw new Error(\"Must be implemented by subclass.\"); }\r\n  static fromJSON() { throw new Error(\"Must be implemented by subclass.\"); }\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype PullRequestJson = {|\r\n  +url: string,\r\n  +number: number,\r\n  +title: string,\r\n  +body: string,\r\n|};\r\nclass PullRequestPayload extends GithubNodePayload<PullRequestJson> {\r\n  constructor(record: PullRequestJson) {\r\n    super(record, \"PULL_REQUEST\");\r\n  }\r\n  number(): number { return this.record.number; }\r\n  title(): string { return this.record.title; }\r\n  body(): string { return this.record.body; }\r\n  toJSON() { return toCompat(PULL_REQUEST_COMPAT_INFO, this.record); }\r\n  static fromJSON(json) { return fromCompat(PULL_REQUEST_COMPAT_INFO, json); }\r\n}\r\nconst PULL_REQUEST_COMPAT_INFO: CompatInfo = {\r\n  type: \"sourcecred/sourcecred/github/PullRequest\",\r\n  version: \"0.1.0\",\r\n};\r\n\r\ntype PullRequestCommentJson = {|+url: string, /* elided */|};\r\ndeclare class PullRequestCommentPayload\r\nextends GithubNodePayload<PullRequestCommentJson> {\r\n  constructor(record: PullRequestJson): void;\r\n  /* elided */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that a `NodePayload` should have well-defined serialization\r\nbehavior—probably, but not necessarily, via an explicit `toJSON` method.\r\nBy convention, nodes will have a `static fromJSON` for deserialization.\r\n\r\nNote also that `NodePayload`s exist outside the context of a graph: they\r\nsimply define data.\r\n\r\nThe second core interface is `NodeReference`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ninterface NodeReference {\r\n  graph(): Graph;\r\n  address(): Address;\r\n  get(): ?Node<any, any>;\r\n\r\n  neighbors(options?: NeighborhoodOptions): Iterator<NodeReference>;\r\n}\r\ntype NeighborhoodOptions = {|\r\n  +nodeType?: string,\r\n  +edgeType?: string,\r\n  +direction?: \"IN\" | \"OUT\" | \"ANY\",\r\n|};\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, we make use of the following useful type alias, which binds\r\ntogether the two core interfaces:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntype Node<NR: NodeReference, NP: NodePayload> = {|\r\n  +ref: NR,\r\n  +payload: NP,\r\n|};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, a `Node<NR, NP>` is just a pair of an `NR` and an `NP`.\r\n\r\nNote that a `NodeReference` is tied to a specific node and a specific\r\ngraph. The `core/graph.js` module itself will include one important\r\nimplementation of this interface:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass IndexedNodeReference implements NodeReference {\r\n  _graph: Graph;\r\n  _address: Address;\r\n  _index: ?number;\r\n  _indexVersion: number;  // explained below\r\n\r\n  constructor(graph, address, index, version) { /* assignments */ }\r\n\r\n  graph() { return this._graph; }\r\n  address() { return this._address; }\r\n\r\n  get() {\r\n    this._ensureUpToDate();\r\n    if (this._index == null) {\r\n      return undefined;\r\n    } else {\r\n      return this._graph._nodes[this._index].value;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  neighbors(options?: NeighborhoodOptions) {\r\n    this._ensureUpToDate();\r\n    if (this._index == null) {\r\n      return [].values();\r\n    } else {\r\n      return this._graph._internalNeighbors(this._index, options);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  _ensureUpToDate() {\r\n    if (this._graph._indexVersion !== this._indexVersion) {\r\n      this._indexVersion = this._graph._indexVersion;\r\n      this._index = this._graph._addressToIndex(this._address);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe salient point of this implementation is that it enables fast access\r\nof graph operations by remaining inside the integer-indexed layer,\r\nwithout leaking to clients the details of how this works. Notable in\r\nthis implementation is the `_indexVersion` field, which enables a graph\r\nto garbage-collect, compress, permute, or otherwise change its node\r\nindex without breaking extant references and without needing to keep\r\ntrack of them: any such operation simply increments the graph’s\r\n`_indexVersion` attribute, and any `IndexedNodeReference` will pick up\r\nthe change on any subsequent actions. Again, though, this is just a\r\nconvenient implementation detail.\r\n\r\nClients won’t directly use `IndexedNodeReference`, though; this will be\r\na non-exported class of the `core/graph.js` module. Instead, they will\r\nprovide a semantic extension of `NodeDelegateReference`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass NodeDelegateReference implements NodeReference {\r\n  _base: NodeReference;\r\n  constructor(base: NodeReference) {\r\n    this._base = base;\r\n  }\r\n  graph() { return this._base.graph(); }\r\n  address() { return this._base.address(); }\r\n  get() { return this._base.get(); }\r\n  neighbors(options?: NeighborhoodOptions) {\r\n    return this._base.neighbors(options);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Note: `NodeDelegateReference` should actually have `_base` as a\r\n`Symbol`, but doing so requires Flow-appeasing hackery that I don’t want\r\nto include in this high-level overview.)\r\n\r\nBy extending this class, plugins gain great power:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass GithubNodeReference extends NodeDelegateReference {\r\n  constructor(base: NodeReference) {\r\n    super(base);\r\n    const address = base.address();\r\n    if (address.pluginName !== \"sourcecred/github-beta\") {\r\n      throw new Error(\"pluginName: \" + address.pluginName);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass PullRequestReference extends GithubNodeReference {\r\n  constructor(base: NodeReference) {\r\n    super(base);\r\n  }\r\n  *comments(): Iterator<PullRequestCommentReference> {\r\n    for (const neighbor of this.neighbors({\r\n      direction: \"OUT\",\r\n      nodeType: \"PULL_REQUEST_COMMENT\",\r\n      edgeType: \"CONTAINS\",\r\n    })) {\r\n      if (!(neighbor instanceof PullRequestCommentReference)) {\r\n        throw new Error(neighbor.constructor.name);\r\n      }\r\n      yield neighbor;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndeclare class PullRequestCommentReference extends GithubNodeReference {\r\n  /* elided */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Plugin handlers\r\n\r\nBefore the methods on `Graph` can be updated to take advantage of these\r\nstructures, a graph needs to know about the different kinds of plugins.\r\nA plugin handler has the following interface:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ninterface PluginHandler<NR: NodeReference, NP: NodePayload> {\r\n  /**\r\n   * Enrich a base reference with plugin-/domain-specific properties.\r\n   */\r\n  createReference(baseReference: NodeReference, payload: NP): NR;\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Deserialize a payload, which is guaranteed to be the serialization\r\n   * of a previous `NP`.\r\n   */\r\n  fromJSON(json: Json): NP;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that a perfectly legal “low-effort” implementation of this is:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst noopHandler: PluginHandler<NodeReference, NodePayload> = {\r\n  createReference: (reference, _) => reference,\r\n  fromJSON: (json: any) => ({address() { return json.address; }}),\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nA more common implementation might be something like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass GithubPluginHandler\r\nimplements PluginHandler<GithubNodeReference, GithubNodePayload<any>> {\r\n  createReference(reference) {\r\n    const address = reference.address();\r\n    if (address.pluginName !== \"sourcecred/github-beta\") {\r\n      throw new Error(\"pluginName: \" + address.pluginName);\r\n    }\r\n    const type: GithubNodeType = ((address.type: string): any);\r\n    switch (type) {\r\n      case \"PULL_REQUEST\":\r\n        return new PullRequestReference(reference);\r\n      case \"PULL_REQUEST_COMMENT\":\r\n        return new PullRequestCommentReference(reference);\r\n      default:\r\n        // eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-expressions\r\n        (type: empty);\r\n        throw new Error(\"type: \" + type);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  fromJSON(json: any) {\r\n    const type: GithubNodeType = ((json.type: string): any);\r\n    switch (type) {\r\n      case \"PULL_REQUEST\":\r\n        return new PullRequestPayload(json);\r\n      case \"PULL_REQUEST_COMMENT\":\r\n        return new PullRequestCommentPayload(json);\r\n      default:\r\n        // eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-expressions\r\n        (type: empty);\r\n        throw new Error(\"type: \" + type);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The `Graph` class\r\n\r\nA graph is associated with a fixed set of plugins:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntype Plugins = {[pluginName: string]: PluginHandler<any, any>};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe graph learns about these at construction time, either via the\r\nconstructor or the `static fromJSON` method.\r\n\r\nGraphs, of course, also need to refer to edges. In this proposal, we\r\nleave edges structurally unchanged, but remove their type parameters:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntype Edge = {|\r\n  +address: Address,\r\n  +src: Address,\r\n  +dst: Address,\r\n  +payload: any,\r\n|};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `Graph` class then looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndeclare class Graph /* no type parameters! */ {\r\n  constructor(plugins: Plugins): void;\r\n\r\n  copy(): Graph;\r\n  equals(that: Graph): boolean;\r\n\r\n  toJSON(): GraphJson;\r\n  static fromJSON(json: GraphJson, plugins: Plugins): Graph;\r\n\r\n  addNode(np: NodePayload): this;\r\n  addEdge(edge: Edge): this;\r\n\r\n  removeNode(address: Address): this;\r\n  removeEdge(address: Address): this;\r\n\r\n  node(address: Address): ?Node<any, any>;\r\n  edge(address: Address): ?Edge;\r\n  nodeReference(address: Address): NodeReference /* see commentary below */;\r\n\r\n  nodes(filter?: {|+type?: string|}): Iterator<Node<any, any>>;\r\n  edges(filter?: {|+type?: string|}): Iterator<Edge>;\r\n\r\n  static mergeConservative(Iterator<Graph>): Graph;\r\n\r\n  // Some implementation details (but not all of them)…\r\n  _nodes: {|+address: Address, +value: Node<any, any> | void|}[];\r\n  _indexVersion: number;\r\n  _internalNeighbors(\r\n    number: number,\r\n    options?: NeighborhoodOptions\r\n  ): Iterator<NodeReference>;\r\n  _addressToIndex(address: Address): ?number;\r\n}\r\ntype GraphJson = {/* elided */};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI’ll draw attention to a few things in this proposal, which I am open to\r\nchanging.\r\n\r\n  - APIs provide iterators by default. Conversion with `Array.from` is\r\n    easy. Retrofitting clients to stream data when possible only becomes\r\n    harder as we go on.\r\n  - I’ve removed `neighborhood`. Clients of `Graph` will certainly want\r\n    to compute neighborhoods, but they should always do so via a\r\n    `NodeReference`, probably one that eventually delegates to an\r\n    `IndexedNodeReference`. Failure to do so creates a needless\r\n    performance hit. If we like this pattern, we can specify future\r\n    structural methods (like `connectedComponent` or something) in this\r\n    way as well.\r\n  - I’ve removed the binary version of `mergeConservative`. As far as I\r\n    can tell, it is strictly inferior to the variadic version, and\r\n    encourages bad performance.\r\n  - I’ve removed the non-conservative `merge`. This method actually\r\n    provided some value in principle, but we never actually used it. If\r\n    we want to keep it around, that’d be fine with me.\r\n\r\nSome things that are implicit from the types, but are worth mentioning:\r\n\r\n  - Whenever possible, the graph will retain a canonical `NodeReference`\r\n    instance for any given node: that is, it will try to call\r\n    `createReference` only once. Plugins shouldn’t depend on this for\r\n    correctness, but it might be helpful for their caching patterns.\r\n  - The new serialized form will attach plugin names to nodes, either\r\n    individually or by bucketing (each has advantages). Nodes themselves\r\n    will be serialized `NodePayload`s. At `fromJSON` time, the graph\r\n    will re-enrich all nodes with their appropriate plugins to get\r\n    payloads and references.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the proper semantics of `nodeReference` are not entirely\r\nclear. There are four cases, depending on the `address` argument passed\r\nto this method:\r\n\r\n  1. The address corresponds to a node in the graph.\r\n  2. The address corresponds to a node that does not appear in the\r\n     graph, but has incident edges in the graph.\r\n  3. The address corresponds to a phantom node—a node that does not\r\n     exist in the graph and does not have incident edges, but still\r\n     appears in `_nodes` due to a prior call to `removeNode`.\r\n  4. The address has never been seen before.\r\n\r\nCorrespondingly:\r\n\r\n  - The semantics for case (1) are clear.\r\n  - It seems highly probable that, for case (2), we should return a\r\n    non-null reference: otherwise, it is not clear how we can explore\r\n    the structure around nodes that we know exist but do not have\r\n    directly (e.g., to answer the question, “what other commits has the\r\n    author of this commit authored?” when the “commit” notion comes from\r\n    a different plugin than the “author” notion (say, a Git plugin and\r\n    an OAuth plugin), and only the commit graph is loaded).\r\n  - It also seems clear that cases (3) and (4) should have the same\r\n    semantics as each other, but it is less clear what these should be.\r\n  - In these cases, we could elect to either return `undefined` or to\r\n    return a “null object”: an object for which `get()` returns `null`\r\n    and `neighbors(_)` returns `[].values()`.\r\n  - We should also ask—is the address required to be associated with a\r\n    known plugin? If so, should we ask the plugin to give us a\r\n    `NodeReference` instance specific to that plugin?\r\n  - If we later learn about this node, can the formerly dangling\r\n    reference come “back online”? Should it?\r\n  - Does this mean that calling `nodeReference` can change the internal\r\n    state of the graph? How does this impact the graph’s ability to\r\n    compress its `_nodes`?\r\n\r\nSome of these latter questions apply in case (2), too.\r\n\r\nOne resolution to, I think, all of these questions is to change the\r\n`PluginHandler.createReference` method so that it does not accept a\r\n`NodePayload`, or at least to make the payload optional. This has the\r\nnice property that `PluginHandler<NR, NP>` has two simple functions: one\r\nto enrich a base reference into an `NR`, and one to enrich a JSON blob\r\ninto an `NP`. I suspect that this is likely a good solution, but I am\r\ninterested to hear other opinions.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion and next steps\r\n\r\nThis API encompasses an improvement to how nodes are handled. Clients\r\nwill usually work with either a `Node<NR, NP>` or a `NodeReference`\r\nalone. There is still a bit of friction in that some methods are\r\ninherently on the reference while others are on the porcelain, but this\r\nis not actually a problem when the `Node<NR, NP>` is treated as a\r\npackage (not destructured): consider\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction someActions(\r\n  someRef: PullRequestReference,\r\n  someNode: Node<PullRequestReference, PullRequestPayload>\r\n) {\r\n  someRef.comments();        // easy\r\n  someNode.ref.comments();   // no problem\r\n  someNode.payload.title();  // piece of cake\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou have to pay a few extra characters for `.ref` or `.payload`, but the\r\ntypechecker will help you out.\r\n\r\nWe may want to do something similar for edges in the future, but also\r\nperhaps not. Edges are definitely different from nodes: we never really\r\nreference them by address (`Graph.edge` is currently never called\r\noutside of test code and `graph.js` itself), so something more like\r\ncontent-addressing might make more sense. But that is not an entirely\r\nstraightforward change from our current model.\r\n\r\nI still think that we should plan to eventually remove `type` from being\r\nprivileged on the address. The `type` and `id` properties together\r\nactually represent a plugin-specific set of values that are used to\r\nuniquely determine the identity of a node, and which we therefore\r\nrequire to always be available—even when the full contents of a node are\r\nnot loaded. This grants us more flexibility: perhaps it makes more sense\r\nto have\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntype UserId = {|+type: \"USER\", +login: string|};\r\ntype PullRequestId = {|\r\n  +type: \"PULL_REQUEST\",\r\n  +repositoryOwner: string,\r\n  +repositoryName: string,\r\n  +number: number,\r\n|};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, functions like `neighbors` and `nodes` greatly increase in power,\r\nas we filter not just on `type` but on an arbitrary subset of these\r\nidentifying characteristics:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst myTreeEntries = neighborsV2({\r\n  direction: \"OUT\",\r\n  nodeFilter: {\r\n    pluginName: \"sourcecred/git-beta\", \r\n    id: {\r\n      type: \"TREE_ENTRY\",\r\n      name: \"pygravitydefier\",\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n});\r\nconst allFirstPrs = nodesV2({\r\n  pluginName: \"sourcecred/github-beta\",\r\n  id: {\r\n    type: \"PULL_REQUEST\",\r\n    number: 1,\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n\r\ntype FilterV2 = {|+pluginName?: string, +id?: Object|};\r\ntype NeighborhoodOptionsV2 = {|\r\n  +nodeFilter?: FilterV2,\r\n  +edgeFilter?: FilterV2,\r\n  +direction?: \"IN\" | \"OUT\" | \"ANY\",\r\n|};\r\n\r\ndeclare function neighborsV2(\r\n  options?: NeighborhoodOptionsV2\r\n): Iterator<NodeReference>;\r\ndeclare function nodesV2(filter?: FilterV2): Iterator<Node<any, any>>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that’s all for another day. For now, I’ll take comments and\r\nsuggestions on the above proposal, and—if all goes well—begin\r\nimplementing it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome external shims, just to make the post typecheck…\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntype Json =\r\n  | string \r\n  | number \r\n  | {[string]: Json}\r\n  | $ReadOnlyArray<Json> \r\n  | true \r\n  | false \r\n  | null\r\n  ;\r\ntype CompatInfo = {|\r\n  +type: string,\r\n  +version: string,\r\n|};\r\ndeclare function toCompat(compatInfo: CompatInfo, _: any): any;\r\ndeclare function fromCompat(compatInfo: CompatInfo, _: any, _?: any): any;\r\n```\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000190\u0000391216116\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"391216116","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"190","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/190#issuecomment-391216116","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"@decentralion RFC, please."},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000190\u0000391447851\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"391447851","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"190","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/190#issuecomment-391447851","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"Per @decentralion 's suggestion, I've created PR #296 to discuss this design doc."},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000190\u0000401571601\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"401571601","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"190","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/190#issuecomment-401571601","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"Duly considered."},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000194\u0000386163362\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"386163362","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"194","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/194#issuecomment-386163362","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"cc @decentralion "},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000194\u0000386361392\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"386361392","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"194","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/194#issuecomment-386361392","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"How about \"credbot\"?

It seems like clearly a good thing to do.\r\n\r\nSecond: it seems that this kind of data (partial results and\r\ncontinuations) should be stored in a plugin-specific data directory, so\r\nwe’ll want some simple abstraction for that.\r\n\r\nThird: I note that the proposal assumes that the queries will fetch a\r\nconsistent state of the repository over multiple requests. This is of\r\ncourse not true in general. Now, this assumption is already present in\r\nthe current version of the code, basically by necessity: we can’t\r\ninstruct GitHub to commit a DB snapshot, for obvious reasons, so this is\r\njust another design constraint that we have to consider. But the model\r\ndescribed in your point (2) greatly increases the strength of the\r\nassumption: we’re assuming that results from a repository are\r\nconservative extensions of not just “very recent” results but also\r\nresults at arbitrary times in the past. This changes the game from “if\r\nyour queries are fast enough and your repository isn’t being touched\r\nevery second, you’re probably okay” to “sooner or later, someone _will_\r\ndelete a comment in the repository (or make some other incompatible\r\nchange), at which point you’re out of luck”. This may motivate us to\r\ndevise some intermediate format that is robust to such modifications.\r\nFor instance, currently the continuation queries have associated\r\nstructures like, “run this continuation, then merge it into element 17\r\nof `results.repository.issues.nodes`” or whatever. Replacing indexing\r\nwith some more stable content address (issue number, unique pull request\r\nreview ID, etc.) could improve robustness.\r\n\r\nFourth: there are two degrees to which we could implement the proposal,\r\nwhich vary in difficulty. Implementing point (1) of your list is\r\nreasonably tractable: once we have the plugin-specific data directory\r\nworking, this change should probably be about a day’s work. But your\r\npoint (2) is a bit harder. Currently, when a query returns with\r\n`hasNextPage: false`, we consume the relevant continuation, because we\r\nhave found all relevant data. The model that you propose requires\r\nkeeping around these continuations and querying them again when we want\r\nto check for updates to the graph. This is certainly possible, but will\r\ntake some doing—especially if we want to be robust to long-term\r\nbackward-incompatible changes, as described above.\r\n\r\nFinally, and related only indirectly to this conversation: as we make\r\nthe GraphQL logic more complex, we may want to keep in mind the option\r\nof autogenerating Flow types from the GraphQL schema.\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000350\u0000395217826\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"395217826","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"350","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/350#issuecomment-395217826","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"mikeal"}],"body":"One thing you may also want to consider in the future if you're trying to pull in more data across GitHub: starting with a graph populated by continual updates from gharchive https://www.gharchive.org/\r\n\r\nIf you already know all the issues and base level information and just need to get comments or other leaf data out of GraphQL there's some tricks you can do with the search API to run those sub-queries across 100 specific issues or repos or people all at once by creating a large search string with each one."},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000350\u0000395222471\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"395222471","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"350","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/350#issuecomment-395222471","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":" ### Plugin Specific Directories\r\n\r\nI agree; the `Git` plugin would benefit even more from caching its\r\nresults than the GitHub plugin does. (I believe we would not have\r\nconsistency issues?)\r\n\r\n### Consistency issues\r\n\r\nIn the long term, if this system is to be decentralized, we can't avoid\r\nthinking about consistency issues. Within individual scopes it's\r\npossible to maintain consistency; across scopes (e.g. plugin boundaries)\r\nit's much harder. \r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to have a design discussion about how to handle\r\nconsistency problems in general. The space of possible\r\nsolutions is very large; for example, making a blockchain would be one\r\nway to do it. But that would introduce enormous complexity which is\r\nincidental to SourceCred's present goals, so: let's not :)\r\n\r\nThe core algorithms will need to be accommodating of cases where\r\nconsistency has been violated. I think we can do this in a generalizable\r\nway by handling all reconciliation when merging graphs, so that any\r\ngraph can be considered internally consistent. Then we can provide\r\nscoped resolvers that can use plugin-specific logic to accommodate their\r\nown inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nAs other plugins begin interacting more richly with the GitHub plugin,\r\nwe'll need to solve consistency for the GitHub plugin. But for now, we\r\n_could_ punt on it.\r\n\r\nI would really like if we can get to a solution that is robust, even if\r\nnot fully correct. That is, when underlying consistency is violated, it\r\nmay show locally corrupted / inconsistent data, but the data still\r\nloads, displays the same UI, approximately the same PageRank. \r\n\r\nThen we can implement the GitHub plugin caching with a ~24 hour TTL,\r\nwhich I think will minimize the rate of consistency problems, and also\r\nmake the software feel far more performant. \r\n\r\nAlternatively: we can implement the caching purely at the CLI layer;\r\nrather than getting true incremental querying, we could just cache the\r\nresult of `sourcecred graph foo bar` with a 24hr TTL. I guess this would\r\nmanifest similar performance benefits with a fraction of the\r\nimplementation complexity. Then we can focus instead on actually\r\ndeveloping credit attribution. :)\r\n\r\n### Autogenerating flow types for GraphQL\r\n\r\nI think this is pretty low priority. The manual process seems fine to\r\nme. We're unlikely to merge many bugs because Flow will complain at type\r\nusage even if it wasn't added properly at source. And at our current\r\nrate of GraphQL query modification, the labor savings from automating it\r\nwill not be significant. \r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000350\u0000395225556\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"395225556","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"350","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/350#issuecomment-395225556","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"@mikeal the important thing to us with the GitHub API is that it's possible to query just for an individual repository or organization's data in an efficient fashion.

In the current system (as of\r\n#480), link destinations are ignored entirely, and link text is treated\r\nas normal text. I chose this design because it is simple to understand\r\nand implement, and I preferred to get a simple version of Markdown\r\nworking rather than turn on a complicated system from scratch.

But it does not detect explicit links, because the URL does not\r\nappear in the text. This is a problem worth fixing.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nConsider the following modifications to the current system:\r\n\r\n  - Modify the spec of `deformat` such that it does not collapse link\r\n    text into the surrounding context.\r\n\r\n  - Modify the spec of `textBlocks` such that it returns not `string[]`\r\n    but `TextBlock[]`, where `TextBlock` is a discriminated union:\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    type TextBlock =\r\n      | {|+type: \"TEXT\", +value: string|}\r\n      | {|+type: \"LINK_DESTINATION\", +value: string|};\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    When processing a link, the new `textBlocks` would ignore the link\r\n    text entirely, emitting only a `LINK_DESTINATION` block.\r\n\r\n  - Modify `parseReferences` such that it processes the blocks as\r\n    follows:\r\n      - For `TEXT` blocks, all types of references (including URL\r\n        references) are parsed.\r\n      - For `LINK_DESTINATION` blocks, only URL references are parsed.\r\n\r\nHere are some effects of the resulting system:\r\n\r\n  - Raw URLs are still parsed, because the URL will appear in a text\r\n    block and be parsed accordingly.\r\n  - Autolinked URLs are still parsed (exactly once), due to the link\r\n    destination.\r\n  - Explicit links are now parsed once per occurrence. For instance, in\r\n    the “repeated link reference” example above, two references to\r\n    `https://example.com/` will be identified. I believe that this is\r\n    the correct behavior: the body does, in fact, have two references.\r\n    (Downstream clients can of course deduplicate this if they choose.)\r\n  - In a link like `[see #32 and #33](https://example.com/)`, the issue\r\n    references `#32` and `#33` are no longer parsed. I tentatively\r\n    believe that this is a good thing—it is strange that a link should\r\n    be said to refer to things other than its destination—but I am\r\n    willing to be convinced otherwise.\r\n  - In a link like `[@decentralion](https://github.com/decentralion)`,\r\n    we only detect one username reference (by URL, not by `@`-handle).\r\n    I tentatively believe that this is a good thing: semantically, there\r\n    is only one reference.\r\n  - In `[Paired with @decentralion](https://github.com/decentralion)`,\r\n    we detect a URL-based username reference, but not a paired-with\r\n    reference. Similarly, in `[Paired][1] with @decentralion`, we do not\r\n    detect a paired-with reference.\r\n\r\nAll consequences except for the last one seem positive to me. The last\r\none is probably a bad thing. However, I don’t see a semantics that\r\noffers strictly better behavior on all cases. For instance, we could\r\nproperly detect this paired-with reference by parsing all references\r\ninside `LINK_DESTINATION` blocks, but this causes many other cases to\r\nmisbehave: e.g., autolinks generate multiple references.\r\n\r\nI think that I’d like to accept the imperfection due to the last point\r\nand switch to this system: the benefit of parsing `[explicit links][1]`\r\noutweighs, in my mind, the false negatives in the cases where we\r\nactually want to have multiple overlapping references.\r\n\r\ncc @decentralion; thoughts appreciated.\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000433\u0000401439238\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"401439238","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"433","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/433#issuecomment-401439238","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"Fixed by #445"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000465\u0000401709755\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"401709755","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"465","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/465#issuecomment-401709755","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"What follows are some late-night thoughts, based on having taken a stab at writing a `PluginAdapterCollection` class. \r\n\r\nI notice there's some redundancy between `plugins` and `types`:\r\n- They both have names\r\n- They both have prefixes\r\n- While only the `plugin` has a `nodeDescription` method, internally that method effectively delegates to the types (switch over type).\r\n\r\nWhat if we unify them into a shared recursive abstraction: (note: I'm writing only for nodes, but assume there will be corresponding types for edges too)\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntype NodeType = {|\r\n  +name: string,\r\n  +prefix: NodeAddressT,\r\n  +description: (NodeAddressT) => string,\r\n  +render: (NodeAddressT) => React.Component,\r\n  +weight: (NodeAddressT) => NodeWeight,\r\n|}\r\n\r\ninterface PluginAdapter {|\r\n  +name: string,\r\n  +edgeTypes: EdgeType[],\r\n  +nodeTypes: NodeType[],\r\n  +graph: () => Graph,\r\n|}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere can also be a `BaseNodeType`:\r\n```js\r\nconst baseNodeType = {\r\nname: \"[base type]\",\r\nprefix: NodeAddress.empty,\r\ndescription: (n) => NodeAddress.toString(n),\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, when finding the right method for a given node address, we choose the most specific Type available (and the presence of the BaseNodeType ensures that we always find a type).

For example, suppose we have a graph with the\r\nfollowing nodes:\r\n\r\n- `r`: SourceCred repository\r\n- `p1`, `p2`: pull requests\r\n- `i1`: an issue\r\n- `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`: commits\r\n\r\nOne example of a weight function is `w`, a prior over node types, defined as\r\nfollows. (I use base two logarithms due to personal preference.)\r\n\r\n```\r\nw(r) = 1\r\nw(p1, p2) = 0\r\nw(i1) = -1\r\nw(c1, c2, c3, c4) = -2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis expreses that repositories are twice as important as pulls, which are\r\ntwice as important as issues, which are twice as important as commits.\r\nObviously, this is equivalent to another weight function, `w'`, defined as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nw'(r) = 0\r\nw'(p1, p2) = -1\r\nw'(i1) = -2\r\nw'(c1, c2, c3, c4) = -3\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithin this equivalence class, let's consider \"canonical\" the weight function\r\nwhich sums to 0, which in this case is \r\n\r\n```\r\nw_c(r) = 2\r\nw_c(p1, p2) = 1\r\nw_c(i1) =  0\r\nw_c(c1, c2, c3, c4) = -1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow let's consider another weight function, this time defined only over the pull requests.\r\nPerhaps it is counting the lines of code, so we can call it `loc`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nloc(p1) = 1\r\nloc(p2) = 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis expresses that p1 is twice as important as p2. However, it is not\r\nmeaningfully defined over all of the nodes in the graph. It might seem natural\r\nto pad the remaining entries with zero, but this makes equivalent relative\r\nweightings of pulls no longer equivalent in how they modify the whole graph.\r\nConsider the functions `loc'` and `loc''`\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nloc'(p1) = 1\r\nloc'(p2) = 0\r\nloc'(r, i1, c1, c2, c3, c4) = 0\r\n\r\n\r\nloc''(p1) = 0\r\nloc''(p2) = -1\r\nloc''(r1, i1, c1, c2, c3, c4) = 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though `loc'` and `loc''` are expressing the same relative weightings\r\nbetween pull requests, `loc'` also shifts overall weight in the graph towards\r\npull requests in general, while `loc''` shifts overall weight in the graph away\r\nfrom pull requests. This is an unwanted side effect. Therefore, I think it\r\nmakes more sense for weighting functions only to be defined for the subset of\r\nnodes that they explicitly compare. We can then define a function\r\n`normalize` which turns the weighting into a canonical weight distribution via\r\nthe following procedure:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntype LogWeight = number;\r\n// Not guaranteed to have every node in the graph. Not normalized\r\ntype Weighting = Map<NodeAddressT, LogWeight>;\r\n\r\n// Guaranteed to have every node in the graph, and is normalized.\r\ntype NormalizedWeighting = Map<NodeAddressT, LogWeight>;\r\n\r\nnormalize(graph: Graph, weighting: Weighting): NormalizedWeighting\r\n  let totalWeight = 0;\r\n  let numWeights = 0;\r\n  for (const weight of weighting.values()) {\r\n    totalWeight += weight;\r\n    numWeights++;\r\n  }\r\n  const normalizer = totalWeight / numWeights;\r\n  const normWeighting: NormalizedWeighting = new Map();\r\n  for (const node of graph.nodes()) {\r\n    const w = weighting.get(node);\r\n    normWeighting.set(node, w == null ? 0 : w - normalizer)\r\n  }\r\n  return normWeighting;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has the advantage that it makes it easy to specify relative comparisons between\r\ndifferent nodestypes in easy-to-grok units (a is 2x as important as b), without accidentally\r\nshifting the distribution over nodes that are out of scope for that weighting.\r\n\r\nTo round things out, here are psuedocode implementations of the three types of\r\nweight functions described above.\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\n### Prior over types\r\n\r\nconst typeToWeight = {\r\n  GitHub.Repo: 5,\r\n  GitHub.User: 3,\r\n  GitHub.Pull: 2,\r\n  GitHub.Issue: 1,\r\n  GitHub.Review: 0,\r\n  GitHub.Comment: -1,\r\n  Git.Commit: 0,\r\n  Git.Tree: -4,\r\n  Git.Blob: -5,\r\n  Git.TreeEntry: -5,\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst typeWeight = (n: NodeAddressT) => {\r\n  return typeToWeight[getType(n)]\r\n}\r\n\r\n### Domain specific comparison\r\n\r\nconst locWeight = (n: NodeAddressT) => {\r\n  if (getType(n) === GitHub.Pull) {\r\n    const pull = githubRelationalView.get(n);\r\n    const weight = Math.log(pull.additions() + pull.deletions);\r\n    return weight;\r\n  }\r\n  return undefined;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n### Subproject comparison\r\n\r\nconst canonicalBackendNodes = new Set([\r\n  // list of nodes, as voted on by users or created via TCR or \r\n  // some other mechanism\r\n])\r\n\r\nconst backendWeight = (n: NodeAddressT) => {\r\n  if (canonicalBackendNodes.has(n)) {\r\n  if (canonicalBackendNodes.has(n)) {\r\n    return 4; // tunable parameter\r\n  } else {\r\n    return 0;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @wchargin "},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000476\u0000402553689\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"402553689","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"476","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/476#issuecomment-402553689","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"We like the idea of log-space priors, because it’s a natural space in\r\nwhich to think.

Assume that we\r\nonly consider finite, inhabited types. Then:\r\n\r\n  - A `LogDist α` is a total map from `α` to `Real` whose image is\r\n    centered around `0`.\r\n\r\n  - A `Dist α` is a valid probability distribution on `α`, represented\r\n    as a function `f : α → NonnegativeReal` with the constraint that\r\n    `sum (values f) == 1`.\r\n\r\n  - We have `extend : ∀ α, β. (α <: β) ⇒ LogDist α → LogDist β`, defined by\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    extend f (x : α) = f x\r\n    extend f _ = 0\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  - We have `normalize : ∀ α.

LogDist α → Dist α` given by\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    reify f = normalize (exp ∘ f)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  - We would like to define a notion of combination of log-distributions:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    (<>) : ∀ α. LogDist α → LogDist α → LogDist α\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  - This operation should have at least the following property:\r\n\r\n    **Irrelevance.** If `f, g : LogDist α` and `x : α`, and `f x == 0`,\r\n    then `reify g x == reify (f <> g) x`.\r\n    \r\nFrom this formulation, there are a few things to note:\r\n\r\n  - The implementation of `(<>)` given simply by pointwise addition does\r\n    not satisfy the irrelevance property. It will be true that if\r\n    `f x == 0` then `g x == (f <> g) x`, but it need not be true that\r\n    `reify g x == reify (f <> g) x`, because the normalization factors\r\n    in `g` and `f <> g` are, in general, different.\r\n\r\n  - The `Dist` and `LogDist` functors are isomorphic, and in particular\r\n    the operator `(<>)` induces an operator `λ f. λ g. reify (f <> g)`\r\n    for combining non-log-space distributions. The problems are clearly\r\n    equivalent, and while it may be more convenient to work in one space\r\n    or the other, any fundamental problems must exist in both spaces.\r\n\r\n  - Although `(<>)` is a simple operation in log-space, it’s not clear\r\n    how to interpret this in distribution space. We can write down what\r\n    it does, but how, intuitively, is it actually transforming the\r\n    values? What is the interpretation?\r\n\r\n  - The `Dist` functor happens to be a very useful monad (in my opinion,\r\n    an underappreciated one), which already has a notion of combination\r\n    of distributions: `join : ∀ α. Dist (Dist α) → Dist α`. This\r\n    necessarily requires a prior over the distributions themselves. We\r\n    should keep this in mind while designing our semantics: if we\r\n    _don’t_ require a prior over these distributions (as in the API for\r\n    our `(<>)` above), then what are we doing? Are we assuming a uniform\r\n    prior?

Interfaces\r\n    and unions exist only at the level of the type system.\r\n\r\n  - We want to assume that every node is identifiable by an `id`. This\r\n    wreaks havoc on the `Actor` interface, which does not structurally\r\n    extend `Node` (awful design), even though all its implementations\r\n    do.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchemata\r\n--------\r\n\r\nWe make the concession that an interface is treated as a union of its\r\nknown implementations.

It has slightly\r\nnegative effects on code generation compared to hand-written code\r\n(common fieldsets will not be factored out). This concession is really\r\nnot too bad in our case; it incurs an additional ~30 bytes per request\r\nsent to GitHub.\r\n\r\nEvery `object`-type schema is required to have exactly one field of type\r\n`id`, and may have zero or more other fields.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst schema = s.schema({\r\n  Repository: s.object([\r\n    s.field(\"id\", s.id()),\r\n    s.field(\"url\", s.primitive()),\r\n    s.field(\"issues\", s.connection(\"Issue\")),\r\n  ]),\r\n  Issue: s.object([\r\n    s.field(\"id\", s.id()),\r\n    s.field(\"url\", s.primitive()),\r\n    s.field(\"author\", s.node(\"Actor\")),\r\n    s.field(\"parent\", s.node(\"Repository\")),\r\n    s.field(\"title\", s.primitive()),\r\n    s.field(\"comments\", s.connection(\"IssueComment\")),\r\n  ]),\r\n  IssueComment: s.object([\r\n    s.field(\"id\", s.id()),\r\n    // ...\r\n  ]),\r\n  Actor: s.union([\"User\", \"Bot\", \"Organization\"]),  // actually an interface\r\n  User: s.object([\r\n    s.field(\"id\", s.id()),\r\n    s.field(\"url\", s.primitive()),\r\n    s.field(\"login\", s.primitive()),\r\n  ]),\r\n  Bot: /* same */,\r\n  Organization: /* same */,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSchema module (`s`) interface:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport interface Schema {\r\n  schema: ({[Typename]: NodeType}) => Schema;\r\n  object: ($ReadOnlyArray<Field>) => NodeType;\r\n  union: ($ReadOnlyArray<Typename>) => NodeType;\r\n  field: (name: string, type: FieldType) => Field;\r\n  id: () => FieldType;\r\n  primitive: () => FieldType;\r\n  node: (Typename) => FieldType;\r\n  connection: (Typename) => FieldType;\r\n}\r\ntype Typename = string;\r\ndeclare opaque type Schema;\r\ndeclare opaque type NodeType;\r\ndeclare opaque type Field;\r\ndeclare opaque type FieldType;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nEntry point\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nWe need to somehow specify the objects that we care about, and how to\r\nget them in the first place. A simple way to do that is the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst rootRepo = entryPoint({\r\n  type: \"Repository\",\r\n  extract: (response) => response.repository,\r\n  body: (fields) => [\r\n    b.query(\r\n      \"FetchData\",\r\n      [b.param(\"owner\", \"String!\"), b.param(\"name\", \"String!\")],\r\n      [\r\n        b.field(\r\n          \"repository\",\r\n          {owner: b.variable(\"owner\"), name: b.variable(\"name\")},\r\n          fields,\r\n        ),\r\n      ]\r\n    ),\r\n  ],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere may be other similar approaches, some of them perhaps nicer, but\r\nthe simplicity of this approach is appealing.\r\n\r\nAnother high-level approach would be to require that the system work\r\nonly on Id-identified nodes. This would require that the client first\r\nperform one query outside of the system to get a repository’s Id…\r\n\r\n    { repository(owner: \"foo\", name: \"bar\") { id } }\r\n\r\nand then simply feed the system `{type: \"Repository\", id}` to get\r\nstarted. This is maybe simpler from the perspective of the system, but\r\nmaybe more complex for clients.

In principle, this could be structurally shared across\r\n    repositories, but we’ll keep it simple for now.\r\n  - `schema`: A structured sub-GraphQL schema, as described above. This\r\n    is required to remain fixed across invocations with the same cache\r\n    directory; it may be persisted on disk to check for\r\n    data-incompatible code upgrades.\r\n  - `ttl`: Time to live; a duration after which data is to be considered\r\n    stale.\\* This may vary across invocations.\r\n\r\n\\* For liveness, we may wish to relax the definition of staleness to\r\nprevent a case wherein our fetch rate can’t keep up with the TTL.\r\nSemantics to be determined. This isn’t very important for an initial\r\nversion of the system, so we omit discussion.\r\n\r\nDesired operations (methods on `GraphqlMirror`):\r\n\r\n  - `update(root: Ref)`: Make any needed updates for `root` and any\r\n    transitive dependencies. Writes to persistent storage, `sync`ing\r\n    periodically (in particular, `sync`ing at each network request).\r\n  - `denormalize(root: Ref)`: Create a structured form where IDs are\r\n    replaced by their referents and connections are inlined as arrays,\r\n    failing if any transitive dependencies are not met. The result will\r\n    conform to the schema entry for type `root.typename`.\r\n\r\nWorkflow:\r\n\r\n  - The GitHub plugin maintains a standalone registry mapping `Repo` to\r\n    `Ref`. A query `repository(owner: \"foo\", name: \"bar\") { id }` is\r\n    used to populate the repo-ref registry.\r\n  - At `node ./bin/sourcecred.js load` time:\r\n      - Retrieve the repository’s GraphQL ID `id` from the repo-ref\r\n        registry, computing via a single GraphQL query if absent. Let\r\n        `ref` be `{typename: \"Repository\", id}`.\r\n      - Execute `update(ref)`.\r\n      - Let `repo` be `denormalize(ref)`.\r\n      - Construct a `RelationalView` from `repo`, and store it on disk\r\n        in the data directory.\r\n  - At runtime, the relational view is loaded from disk as usual.\r\n\r\nUpdate semantics:\r\n\r\n  - A node is _up to date_ if (a) it is present, (b) its mtime is more\r\n    recent than the TTL, and (c) if it is a connection, it is exhausted.\r\n  - Updating an object node entails fetching its data and replacing the\r\n    existing content.\r\n  - Append-updating a connection node entails fetching any remaining\r\n    elements, starting from its end cursor.\r\n  - Full-updating a connection node essentially entails removing it and\r\n    then append-updating it. Only a full update will pick up deletions,\r\n    reorders, etc. of elements in the list. We may or may not support\r\n    full-updating in the first version, as we do not expect this to be a\r\n    big issue; the data that we care about is append/edit-only in the\r\n    vast majority of cases.\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000622\u0000411929300\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"411929300","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"622","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/622#issuecomment-411929300","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"```sql\r\n-- Current thoughts about representation follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- A singleton table.

There are three evident approaches\r\nto the storage aspect:\r\n  - Store everything in a `db.json` file.\r\n  - Store each object in a separate file, like `issue_17.json`.\r\n  - Use a SQL database or other similar tool.\r\n\r\nThe first option has serious disadvantages. Reading any object requires\r\ndeserializing a massive blob of JSON. Writing any object or making in a\r\nchange requires serializing a similarly massive blob. These limitations\r\nmean that you have to store the entire string in Node memory (unless you\r\nhave some on-the-fly JSON decoder that reads from a stream directly),\r\nand you have to store the whole database in memory to read a single\r\nobject. Node also has limits on the size of a string, which we have\r\nalready hit on large repositories.\r\n\r\nThe second option also has disadvantages. We might easily have tens of\r\nthousands of objects to store—for instance, the GitHub graph for\r\n`metamask/metamask-extension` has 31 853 nodes at last count. This\r\nincurs a lot of syscalls, a lot of context switches, and a lot of\r\ninteraction with the filesystem. Typical filesystems also struggle with\r\ndirectories that have a large number of entries—operations like\r\npathname-to-inode resolution perform a linear scan over the directory\r\nentries—so we’d want to perform some kind of chunking, like Git does\r\nwith `.git/objects/??/*`.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above discussion, it becomes clear that it is silly to\r\ndeal with these problems when the solution is clear: just use an actual\r\ndatabase. SQLite is an attractive choice: it stores its database in a\r\nsingle file, it is lightweight and portable, and it has a plethora of\r\nNode bindings. Thus, we adopt this approach.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this document is a literate SQL script. You can run it\r\nwith\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsrc=/path/to/this/document &&\r\ndb=/tmp/test.db &&\r\nrm -f \"$db\" &&\r\nsqlite3 \"$db\" < <(print_code_fences -v lang=sql \"$src\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `print_code_fences` comes from [this gist][1].\r\n\r\n[1]: https://gist.github.com/wchargin/e7e72370efe58d0959e2fb68065ae539\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Boilerplate</summary>\r\n\r\nFirst, some setup for pretty-printing, and an indication that SQLite\r\nshould check foreign key constraints. (Without the PRAGMA, everything\r\nwould work, but the foreign key annotations would be ignored.)\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n.mode line\r\nPRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nOur goal is to turn a schema for a subset of a GraphQL database into a\r\nschema for a SQL database. We will demonstrate on a subset of the GitHub\r\nschema.\r\n\r\nWe start with a safety check. If the schema changes between invocations,\r\nwe should fail and require the user to blow away all data. The simplest\r\nway to do this is to store a JSON-serialized version of the GraphQL\r\nschema from which we generated the SQL schema, and check at each\r\ninvocation that it matches the schema that we expect. There’s a bit of\r\nredundancy here, but that’s okay (the additional space used is totally\r\nnegligible). We store this data in a singleton table.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE meta (\r\n    json_schema TEXT NOT NULL\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we define what it means for data to be out of date. We say that a\r\nsingle invocation of `node ./bin/sourcecred.js load` is an _update_. An\r\nupdate has an associated timestamp, but an update may write to the\r\ndatabase multiple times (say, between network requests), updating its\r\ntimestamp each time. Then the final timestamp associated with an update\r\nis the time that the update completes.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE updates (\r\n    rowid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\r\n    time_epoch_seconds INTEGER NOT NULL\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur GraphQL objects will be stored as follows. Each GraphQL object has\r\nan entry in the `updates` table, which is only a registry. It stores the\r\nlast time that the object was updated, and the GraphQL type associated\r\nwith the object, but does not store any actual data.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE objects (\r\n    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,\r\n    last_update INTEGER,\r\n    typename TEXT NOT NULL,\r\n    FOREIGN KEY(last_update) REFERENCES updates(rowid)\r\n) WITHOUT ROWID;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe data for an object is stored across three tables, depending on the type of each field.\r\n\r\n  - Primitive data is stored in an type-specific table, like\r\n    `data_Repository`. The fact that this table is type-specific means\r\n    that the actual data can be stored with locality and with strong\r\n    typing.\r\n  - A reference to a single other GraphQL object, like the author of an\r\n    issue or the owner of a repository, is stored in the `links` table.\r\n  - A connection, like the labels on a pull request or the comments on a\r\n    review, is stored in the `connections` table, and individual entries\r\n    in the connection are stored in the `connection_entries` table.\r\n\r\nHere are the schemata for the link and connection tables:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE links (\r\n    parent_id TEXT NOT NULL,\r\n    fieldname TEXT NOT NULL,\r\n    child_id TEXT NOT NULL,\r\n    PRIMARY KEY(parent_id, fieldname),\r\n    FOREIGN KEY(parent_id) REFERENCES objects(id),\r\n    FOREIGN KEY(child_id) REFERENCES objects(id)\r\n) WITHOUT ROWID;\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE connections (\r\n    rowid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\r\n    object_id TEXT NOT NULL,\r\n    fieldname TEXT NOT NULL,\r\n    -- The end cursor may be NULL if no items are in the connection;\r\n    -- this is a consequence of GraphQL and the Relay pagination spec.\r\n    end_cursor TEXT,\r\n    UNIQUE(object_id, fieldname)\r\n);\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE connection_entries (\r\n    rowid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\r\n    conn_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\r\n    idx INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- impose an ordering\r\n    child_id TEXT NOT NULL,\r\n    UNIQUE(conn_id, idx),\r\n    FOREIGN KEY(conn_id) REFERENCES connections(rowid),\r\n    FOREIGN KEY(child_id) REFERENCES objects(id)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI considered using `(object_id, fieldname)` as the primary key for\r\n`connections`. This makes logical sense to me, but it incurs a\r\nnon-trivial increase in the space usage of `connection_entries`. Typical\r\nGitHub IDs range in length from ~20 to ~40 characters (Base64 code\r\nunits), for a total PK size of maybe ~30 to ~50 bytes. TensorFlow, a\r\nlarge repository, has ~32K issues and pull requests combined; if we take\r\neach of these to have 8 or 16 or even 128 transitive connections on\r\naverage, then a numeric connection ID would have around 16 to 22 _bits_\r\ntotal, making it a factor of ~18 smaller than the structured primary\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nHere are some sample type-specific data tables:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE data_Repository (\r\n    id TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\r\n    description TEXT NOT NULL,\r\n    starcount INTEGER NOT NULL,\r\n    FOREIGN KEY(id) REFERENCES objects(id)\r\n) WITHOUT ROWID;\r\nCREATE TABLE data_Organization (\r\n    id TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\r\n    login TEXT NOT NULL,\r\n    FOREIGN KEY(id) REFERENCES objects(id)\r\n) WITHOUT ROWID;\r\nCREATE TABLE data_User (\r\n    id TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\r\n    login TEXT NOT NULL,\r\n    FOREIGN KEY(id) REFERENCES objects(id)\r\n) WITHOUT ROWID;\r\nCREATE TABLE data_Issue (\r\n    id TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\r\n    num INTEGER NOT NULL,\r\n    title TEXT NOT NULL,\r\n    FOREIGN KEY(id) REFERENCES objects(id)\r\n) WITHOUT ROWID;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the foreign keys ensure that any referenced object must exist\r\nin the `objects` table, but this doesn’t mean that we have to have data\r\nfor any referenced object. This is good!\r\n\r\nImplicit in this schema is the key restriction that the set of data that\r\nwe care about is fully determined by an object’s type. For instance, it\r\nis _not_ the case that we want to record a user’s email address if we\r\nreached them from a Git commit, but we don’t care about it if they just\r\nposted an issue. On the contrary: a `User` is a `User`; we define a\r\ncertain set of `User` fields to store, and we store them for every user.\r\n\r\nStoring the typename of an object in the `objects` table is necessary to\r\nhandle interface and union types. For instance, from the GraphQL schema\r\nfor `Repository`, we know that the `owner` property has type `Actor`.\r\nBut an actor could be a user, an organization, or a bot. If all we know\r\nis that a repository’s owner has a particular ID, we won’t know _a\r\npriori_ whether to look up its data in the `data_User` table or the\r\n`data_Organization` table. The `typename` field disambiguates this.\r\n\r\nHere is some example data. We use human-readable IDs for this example,\r\nbut the IDs would actually be GitHub’s opaque Base64-encoded strings.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO updates (time_epoch_seconds) VALUES (1533851800), (1533940400);\r\nINSERT INTO objects (last_update, typename, id) VALUES\r\n    (1, 'Repository', 'repo:sc/sc'),\r\n    (1, 'Organization', 'org:sourcecred'),\r\n    (1, 'Issue', 'issue:sc#1'),\r\n    (2, 'Issue', 'issue:sc#2'),\r\n    (1, 'User', 'user:wchargin'),\r\n    (2, 'User', 'user:decentralion'),\r\n    (1, 'User', 'user:bystander')\r\n;\r\n\r\n-- Now that the objects have been defined, the following insert\r\n-- statements can be commuted in any order.\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO connections (object_id, fieldname, end_cursor) VALUES\r\n    ('repo:sc/sc', 'issues', 'cr123'),\r\n    ('issue:sc#1', 'comments', NULL),\r\n    ('issue:sc#2', 'comments', NULL)\r\n;\r\nINSERT INTO links (parent_id, fieldname, child_id) VALUES\r\n    ('repo:sc/sc', 'owner', 'org:sourcecred'),\r\n    ('issue:sc#1', 'author', 'user:wchargin'),\r\n    ('issue:sc#2', 'author', 'user:decentralion')\r\n;\r\nINSERT INTO connection_entries (conn_id, idx, child_id) VALUES\r\n    (1, 0, 'issue:sc#1'),  -- 1 = (repo:sc/sc).issues\r\n    (1, 1, 'issue:sc#2')   -- 1 = (repo:sc/sc).issues\r\n;\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO data_Repository (id, description, starcount) VALUES\r\n    ('repo:sc/sc', 'open source is pretty cool', 58);\r\nINSERT INTO data_Organization (id, login) VALUES\r\n    ('org:sourcecred', 'sourcecred');\r\nINSERT INTO data_User (id, login) VALUES\r\n    ('user:wchargin', 'wchargin'),\r\n    ('user:decentralion', 'decentralion'),\r\n    ('user:bystander', 'bystander');\r\nINSERT INTO data_Issue (id, num, title) VALUES\r\n    ('issue:sc#1', 1, 'todo: write the code'),\r\n    ('issue:sc#2', 2, 'todo: ship the thing');\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the foreign key constraints prevent some kinds of errors—any\r\nof the following queries would raise an error because `issue:sc#3` and\r\n`user:someone-else` are not registered as objects:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n/*\r\nINSERT INTO data_Issue (id, num, title) VALUES\r\n    ('issue:sc#3', 1, 'todo: add this object to the database');\r\nINSERT INTO links (parent_id, fieldname, child_id) VALUES\r\n    ('issue:sc#1', 'assignee', 'user:someone-else');\r\nINSERT INTO links (parent_id, fieldname, child_id) VALUES\r\n    ('issue:sc#3', 'author', 'user:wchargin');\r\nINSERT INTO connection_entries (conn_id, idx, child_id) VALUES\r\n    (1, 2, 'issue:sc#3');  -- 1 = (repo:sc/sc).issues\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy expressing the links and the connections in the relational model, we\r\ncan leverage the expressive power of SQL to do useful work. For\r\ninstance, if we’ve been asked to bring a particular repository node up\r\nto date, we can ask SQLite exactly which objects are transitively\r\nreferenced and have not been updated since a certain time (which falls\r\nbetween update 1 and update 2):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWITH RECURSIVE cte_deps (id) AS (\r\n    VALUES ('repo:sc/sc')\r\n    UNION SELECT connection_edges.child FROM cte_deps JOIN (\r\n        SELECT parent_id AS parent, child_id AS child FROM links\r\n        UNION\r\n        SELECT object_id AS parent, child_id AS child\r\n        FROM connections JOIN connection_entries\r\n        ON connections.rowid = connection_entries.conn_id\r\n    ) AS connection_edges\r\n    ON cte_deps.id = connection_edges.parent\r\n)\r\nSELECT typename, cte_deps.id, last_update\r\nFROM objects\r\nLEFT OUTER JOIN updates ON last_update = updates.rowid\r\nJOIN cte_deps ON objects.id = cte_deps.id\r\nWHERE last_update IS NULL OR updates.time_epoch_seconds < 1533851801;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis prints:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   typename = Issue\r\n         id = issue:sc#1\r\nlast_update = 1\r\n\r\n   typename = Organization\r\n         id = org:sourcecred\r\nlast_update = 1\r\n\r\n   typename = Repository\r\n         id = repo:sc/sc\r\nlast_update = 1\r\n\r\n   typename = User\r\n         id = user:wchargin\r\nlast_update = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `issue:sc#2` and `user:decentralion` are not printed because\r\nthey were updated recently enough, and `user:bystander` is not printed\r\nbecause there is no transitive reference to that user.\r\n\r\nNext on the table: given a GraphQL schema, what kinds of GraphQL queries\r\ndo we generate?

We could execute a query to get this all at\r\nonce (eliding `pageInfo`, etc. for brevity):\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\nrepository {\r\n  name\r\n  issues(first: 100) {\r\n    nodes {\r\n      title\r\n      comments(first: 100) {\r\n        nodes {\r\n          body\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, we could use a number of “shallow queries”, in which we always only\r\nrequest the `id` of a node in a connection:\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\n# Query 1\r\nrepository {\r\n  name\r\n  issues(first: 100) { nodes { id } }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Query 2\r\nnodes(ids: [\"issue1\", \"issue2\"]) {\r\n  ... on Issue {\r\n    title\r\n    comments(first: 100) { nodes { id } }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Query 3\r\nnodes(ids: [\"comment1\", \"comment2\"]) {\r\n  ... on IssueComment {\r\n    body\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe most striking difference is that shallow queries require more\r\nqueries. This is true, but the difference is not as bad as it may sound.\r\nDue to interleaving, we only experience an additive increase in query\r\ncount, not a multiplicative increase. We present a numerical example\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>A worked example</summary>\r\n\r\nSuppose that we have a repository with 300 issues, each with 300\r\ncomments. Consider the two approaches.\r\n\r\nWith deep queries, we learn the following information at each query:\r\n\r\n 1.   - data for the repo\r\n      - issues 1–100\r\n      - comments 1–100 on issues 1–100\r\n 2.   - issues 101–200\r\n      - comments 1–100 on issues 101–200\r\n      - comments 101–200 on issues 1–100\r\n 3.   - issues 201–300\r\n      - comments 1–200 on issues 201–300\r\n      - comments 101–200 on issues 101–200\r\n      - comments 201–300 on issues 1–100\r\n 4.   - comments 101–200 on issues 201–300\r\n      - comments 201–300 on issues 101–200\r\n 5.   - comments 201–300 on issues 201–300\r\n\r\nWith shallow queries, we learn the following information at each query:\r\n\r\n 1.   - data for the repo\r\n      - IDs for issues 1–100\r\n 2.   - data for issues 1–100\r\n      - IDs for comments 1–100 on issues 1–100\r\n      - IDs for issues 101–200\r\n 3.   - data for comments 1–100 on issues 1–100\r\n      - data for issues 101–200\r\n      - IDs for comments 1–100 on issues 101–200\r\n      - IDs for comments 101–200 on issues 1–100\r\n      - IDs for issues 201–300\r\n 4.   - data for comments 1–100 on issues 101–200\r\n      - data for comments 101–200 on issues 1–100\r\n      - data for issues 201–300\r\n      - IDs for comments 1–100 on issues 201–300\r\n      - IDs for comments 101–200 on issues 101–200\r\n      - IDs for comments 201–300 on issues 1–100\r\n      - IDs for issues 201–300\r\n 5.   - data for comments 1–100 on issues 201–300\r\n      - data for comments 101–200 on issues 101–200\r\n      - data for comments 201–300 on issues 1–100\r\n      - data for issues 201–300\r\n      - IDs for comments 101–200 on issues 201–300\r\n      - IDs for comments 201–300 on issues 101–200\r\n 6.   - data for comments 101–200 on issues 201–300\r\n      - data for comments 201–300 on issues 101–200\r\n      - IDs for comments 201–300 on issues 201–300\r\n 7.   - data for comments 201–300 on issues 201–300\r\n\r\nThe fact that we have 2 levels of nesting translates to 2 extra queries,\r\nnot a factor-2 increase in the number of queries, because we can fetch\r\nin parallel across different levels of nesting. That is, in each shallow\r\nquery, we can fetch data for _all_ objects whose IDs we know.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nA major advantage of using shallow queries is that it significantly\r\ndecreases the worst-case query complexity and thus the size limit. If we\r\nrequest 100 pulls with 100 review with 100 comments, then GitHub notes\r\nthat this query could in principle return a million nodes—even if it is\r\nactually very rare for a pull to have more than (say) 5 reviews. With\r\nshallow queries, we can ask for 100 comments on each of only the 5\r\nreviews that actually exist.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of shallow queries is that it reduces data duplication\r\nin the result. Duplication of object data will be common: if you fetch\r\nthe first 100 pulls from `sourcecred/sourcecred` and their authors,\r\nyou’ll get 43 copies of the user data for `decentralion` and 57 copies\r\nof the user data for `wchargin`. This seems a bit silly, though not\r\nactively problematic as long as the data is consistent.\r\n\r\nIt’s a bit more complicated, though, when the objects being fetched have\r\nconnections. For instance, issue `#483` currently appears twice in the\r\nresults of the below query:\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\n{\r\n  repository(owner: \"sourcecred\", name: \"sourcecred\") {\r\n    labels(first: 5) {\r\n      nodes {\r\n        name\r\n        issues(first: 3) {\r\n          nodes {\r\n            number\r\n            comments(first: 3) {\r\n              nodes {\r\n                id\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe now have to take care when processing the results. Usually, if we\r\nreceive issue comments for an issue that is already in the database, we\r\nappend the comments to those already stored. But here the comments must\r\nbe stored only once even though they appear twice.\r\n\r\nAnother potential advantage of using shallow queries is that this\r\n_might_ help prime GitHub’s servers’ caches, decreasing the effect of\r\nout-of-band rate limiting. See [discussion on #350][d350] for more\r\ndetails. This is purely speculative, but may be helpful.\r\n\r\n[d350]: https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/350#issuecomment-413687270\r\n\r\nTo summarize, shallow queries:\r\n\r\n  - require an additive increase in the number of queries;\r\n  - may have smaller worst-case result size, decreasing API cost;\r\n  - eliminate data duplication (saving bandwidth);\r\n  - eliminate connection entry duplication (simplifying implementation).\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I currently plan to use shallow queries as described\r\nabove. This decision is somewhat but not wholly fundamental; if we need\r\nto reverse it later, it may take some work, but it will be doable\r\nwithout needing to rip out the entire loading system.\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000622\u0000415207987\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"415207987","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"622","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/622#issuecomment-415207987","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"At this point, I turn to implementation, with the following rough plan:\r\n\r\n  - Create the `schema` module.\r\n  - Generate a SQL schema from a GraphQL schema.\r\n  - Implement an “initial query” API that adds the root object (e.g., a\r\n    GitHub repository).\r\n  - Implement updates.\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000622\u0000415690923\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"415690923","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"622","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/622#issuecomment-415690923","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"Just a thought for as you're working on this:\r\nIt would be really great if we could show a progress bar on the GitHub load."},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000622\u0000415802813\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"415802813","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"622","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/622#issuecomment-415802813","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"> It would be really great if we could show a progress bar on the GitHub\r\n> load.\r\n\r\nI’ve been thinking about that. On the one hand, it’s tricky, because\r\nwe’re exploring an object graph of unknown size. But on the other hand,\r\nwe do have some information available.

That is, if our application currently\r\nlooks like this:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<App>\r\n  <CredExplorerApp>\r\n    <RepositorySelect />\r\n    <PagerankTable />\r\n  </CredExplorerApp>\r\n</App>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen with the contexts model it would be changed to look more like:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<AssetsContext.Provider value={assets}>\r\n  <App>\r\n    <CredExplorerApp>\r\n      <AssetsContext.Consumer>\r\n        {(assets) => <RepositorySelect assets={assets} />}\r\n      </AssetsContext.Consumer>\r\n      <PagerankTable />\r\n    </CredExplorerApp>\r\n  </App>\r\n</AssetsContext.Provider>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus, _any component in the application tree_ can magically request\r\naccess to the contexts. (See #663 for slightly more detail.)\r\n\r\nThis is certainly convenient, and while global mutable state is\r\ncertainly to be avoided, it bears noting that this context is not\r\nmutable, and even calling it “state” is a bit of a stretch—it’s more\r\nlike a prop that is automatically threaded down to the appropriate\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\nI implemented this design, and it worked in the expected fashion.\r\nHowever, it was nigh impossible to test. This is primarily because\r\nEnzyme’s support for this context API is pretty abysmal. This approach\r\nwould have basically required us to stop using shallow rendering\r\nanywhere, in favor of always using `mount`, which means that we cannot\r\nactually unit-test frontend components. The fact that we can\r\nshallow-render has been critical to our testing practices, enabling us\r\nto test high-level components like `App` without worrying about mocking\r\nout all the imperative APIs (like `fetch`) that any downtree components\r\nmight need to use.\r\n\r\nAnd even `mount` does not really work—it fails in some trivially basic\r\ncases, which also happen to be cases that we’d want a lot in tests. In\r\nparticular, directly mounting a provider does not work\r\n(<https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/1751>). This does not seem to\r\nbe a good tradeoff.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to pass down the `assets` directly whitherever they\r\nare required—the same semantics as context, but explicit rather than\r\nimplicit. This may sound onerous, but I don’t expect it to be: we\r\nalready do it for `localStore`, and that hasn’t proved problematic as\r\nfar as I know. This also saves _all_ of the headache with testing,\r\nbecause you just have another prop.\r\n\r\nIntegrating this into the router is only slightly weird, and\r\n(importantly) is self-contained: we won’t have to think about it as we\r\nadd or change routes.\r\n\r\nSo, I effected this redesign, and it’s working great. In hindsight, it\r\ncertainly feels like the “right thing” to do. Only relevant changes were\r\nmade to tests, as opposed to needing to fix up everything under the sun,\r\nwhich is a good sign. And it’s always nice to be explicit rather than\r\nimplicit.\r\n\r\nWe may in the future want to move back to a context-based system, if\r\nit’s determined that (a) our testing infrastructure supports it and\r\n(b) manual threading is really annoying for some reason. In such a case,\r\nwe should feel free to do so.\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000ISSUE\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000647\u0000412623271\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"412623271","parent":{"type":"ISSUE","number":"647","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/issues/647#issuecomment-412623271","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"I would like to register that the team is not unanimous on this issue.\r\n:-)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think that it looks much nicer with square corners than\r\nrounded corners.

I'm not sure what's wrong (or even where the error is being thrown from?) - webpack >=2.0 has default support for json so maybe it's the Typescript compiler complaining. One thing I'm noticing is that react-scripts-ts just has a much lower level of polish than react-scripts (which makes sense as its 3rd party to fb). The default config is also really, really noisy and it has some bad usability e.g. blocks compilation on lint errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pros/Cons of Typescript:\r\n\r\n### Pros: \r\nThe typing in commits.ts is pretty nice.

On the other hand, ts didn't let me define a recursive data type :(\r\n\r\nWriting explicit types for every Props and State is pretty nice. \r\n\r\n### Cons:\r\nForces us to pay maintenance cost upfront, rather than once we know what code we're gonna keep.\r\n\r\nForces us to deal with typescript in areas where it doesn't actually provide much lift (its awful when you are just touching html stuff)\r\n\r\nSignificant build and dependency complexity, also \"off the beaten path\" of great tooling provided by fb\r\n\r\n### Alternatives:\r\nyou mentioned react proptypes in email, these actually look better for component boundary typing, as they do runtime checking and therefore can even do things like verify enum values\r\n\r\nwe could use Flow for files like commit.ts where static typing is a big help\r\n\r\n### conclusion\r\nLet's ditch Typescript like you suggested.

Not good! The `precise-commits` package fixes this. Can we either\r\n\r\n  * use `precise-commits` instead, or\r\n  * use only a pre-commit hook that aborts the commit when any file does _not_ match Prettier's format (`prettier --list-different`), and then expect developers to either fix errors manually or install editor hooks?\r\n\r\nOne thing that I noticed is that Prettier doesn't normalize import order (probably because it can't).

The dish heals 3 hearts, and provides a medium-level attack boost for 2:30. The bananas alone heal 1 heart and provide a low-level attack boost for 1:00, and the crab heals 2 hearts and provides a low-level attack boost for 1:30. The edge payloads, without weights, might look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst crabIngredientEdge = {\r\n  address: ...,\r\n  src: crab.address,\r\n  dst: meal.address,\r\n  payload: {\r\n    hearts: 2,\r\n    effect: {\r\n      type: 'attack',\r\n      strength: 'low',\r\n      duration: 90,\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\nconst bananasIngredientEdge = {\r\n  address: ...,\r\n  src: bananas.address,\r\n  dst: meal.address,\r\n  payload: {\r\n    hearts: 1,\r\n    effect: {\r\n      type: 'attack',\r\n      strength: 'low',\r\n      duration: 60,\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we want to ascribe weights, then we need to effectively collapse the `strength` and `duration` and `hearts` fields into one scalar value. **Claim:** It is reasonable that these parameters should be configurable at the plugin level—generically, say, in the sense that “I value hearts more than effect across all dishes”—without modifying the graph. In this case, it would make sense for plugins to provide a valuation function, with signature something like `PluginConfig × Graph × Edge → Weight`. The whole graph might be necessary if, for instance, we cooked mighty bananas together with stamella shrooms—regardless of how much we value effects, the effects cancel out because they are of different classes.\r\n\r\n@dandelionmane: Thoughts? Is this configurability along the lines of your previous thinking?"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000047\u0000369716401\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"369716401","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"47","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/47#issuecomment-369716401","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"Yep, this is exactly the sort of case I had in mind. \r\n\r\nAbstractly: the graph should only contain objective data, which incorporates \"facts\" about the world that are external to perception of the graph itself. Thus, including the number of hearts provided by a food, or a record of the reactions a user had on GitHub, or even the project significance as assigned on GitHub, are all external facts.*\r\n\r\nHowever, determining how to relatively weight different types of contributions should be subjective - you and I should be able to take the same graph and arrive at different weightings, because we value different things. For example, maybe I value pragmatism relatively more and you value purism more, and so we arrive at different valuations for contributions to Haskell vs Javascript. That's a fine disagreement to have.\r\n\r\nKeeping the objective and subjective facets separate makes our disagreement easier to explore and resolve - if we disagree, we can first check that we're both operating from the same objective fact graph, and then compare our value vectors to see where our disagreement originates. In contrast, if the weight is encoded directly in the graph, the subjectivity of our disagreement is smeared all over the graph, and it's harder to tell exactly why we have different results, or how to resolve them in a principled way. Merging the two into one data structure is a bad separation of concerns.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* The boundary between 'objectivity' and 'subjectivity' here is quite interesting, and the concept of 'intersubjectivity' (hat tip to Yuval Noah Harari via [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind)) is quite useful. Basically:\r\n\r\n- Objective -> You can measure it with dumb tools. In principle, we can reach agreement about these facts, even with aliens. \r\n\r\n- Subjective -> Perceptually, as much a property of the viewer as the object. In general, a personal experience and you can't expect anyone else to see it the same.\r\n\r\n- Inter-subjective -> Not a objectively real or measurable; however, it is embedded in the shared subjectivity across many minds, e.g. within a community. Therefore, attains a much greater degree of \"reality\" and \"significance\" than the subjective, while still being more flexible and mutable than the objective\r\n\r\nExamples of the intersubjective include the United States of America, and Google - neither entity \"exists\" in a material way that we can measure; however, because those ideas are embedded in the beliefs and behavior patterns of so many humans, they are durably a part of the world.\r\n\r\nThere is another interesting intersection between objectivity and subjectivity, when you have an objective  record of a subjective judgment. For example, if you gave a :heart: to this comment, your subjectivity becomes objectively verifiable. \r\n\r\nAnd if a project comes together and through some consensus mechanism, they decide to value a bunch of major pull requests as being particularly important, and the results are posted in their git repository, that becomes an objective measure of an intersubjective fact.\r\n\r\nI have a subjective hunch that continuing to keep the objective/subjective/intersubjective distinction in mind as we design the system will be quite helpful. We might imagine the process of producing cred allocations as starting with the \"objective\" and then moving through increasing degrees of inter-subjectivity towards final subjectivity. For example:\r\n\r\nTo start, we generate a maximally objective graph (what we're working on now). This is the shared basis for different ¤-valuations.\r\n\r\nSourceCred tries to take a point of most-objective-intersubjectivity, which is to say we use reported intersubjectivity from projects, and otherwise try to stay neutral and put in as few value judgments as possible. This creates SourceCred¤.\r\n\r\nHowever, other communities will want to make different intersubjective judgments. For example, suppose the ML community wants to have a cred flavor. They want to put a much higher weighting on ML research papers than the entire SourceCred¤ universe, and put a lower weighting on (say) the Node ecosystem. So they fork SourceCred¤ to ML¤. Fortunately, they can continue to use the same root fact graph, they just apply a different value function.\r\n\r\nThen there might be further forks - e.g. within the ML community, there may be a group of people who are focused on AI safety, and they may want a cred of their own that puts a much higher weight on safety-related projects. So they create an \"AISafety\" project that records their intersubjective judgments on which contributions are most valuable to AI Safety. They can include that project in the root objective graphs, so that SourceCred¤ and ML¤ will both be awarded to AI safety contributors; however, they then fork ML¤ to AISafety¤, so that it uses the overall judgments of the ML community, except that the AI Safety subproject has much higher weight.\r\n\r\ncc @achildatplay as this idea of forking as a mechanism for expressing different subjective values was based on conversations with him"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000048\u0000369518298\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"369518298","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"48","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/48#issuecomment-369518298","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"(Note: these will soon be pulled out to fields on a class.)"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000054\u0000100916804\u0000171965363\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"171965363","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"100916804","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"54","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/54#discussion_r171965363","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"`crabLoopEdge`?"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000054\u0000100916804\u0000171965632\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"171965632","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"100916804","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"54","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/54#discussion_r171965632","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"I'd like to see a comment/name here indicating what value this provides: namely, it tests the case where we have non-singleton hom-sets (i.e., there are multiple arrows from `a` to `b`)."},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000054\u0000100916804\u0000171966083\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"171966083","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"100916804","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"54","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/54#discussion_r171966083","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"Let's check `\"works on a graph with self-loops and multiple edges\"`, too."},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000054\u0000100916804\u0000171967355\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"171967355","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"100916804","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"54","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/54#discussion_r171967355","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"How about making the \"normal test cases\" default to working on the advanced graph, unless there's a reason not to?"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000061\u0000100964577\u0000172006359\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"172006359","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"100964577","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"61","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/61#discussion_r172006359","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"why is `deepEqual(this._nodes, that._nodes) && deepEqual(this._edges, that._edges)` not sufficient?"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000061\u0000100964681\u0000172006460\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"172006460","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"100964681","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"61","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/61#discussion_r172006460","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"Good call: it is.

The responsibility of the test script is to test that one piece we won't put into standard CI, which is hitting Github's live API with an API key.\r\n\r\nOn reflection, that makes sense. My auxiliary test plan is auxiliary anyway. I can deal with it. :-)\r\n\r\n> There's inconsistent usage of \"stringify\" vs \"format\" across this file. Maybe just standardize on \"format\", where \"format\" means \"turn this thing into a string, using a provided LineFormatter\". Then this const can be called \"formats\".\r\n\r\nAs I intended to structure it, `stringify` and `format` have different meanings. A stringifier is specific to a type, and knows how to convert instances of that type to strings. So, a `Stringifier<T>` is a function `(T, LineFormatter) => string`—and I’m happy to reify this.\r\n\r\nA formatter, on the other hand, describes how to lay out arbitrary strings; it does not care whether those strings came from a structured form or anywhere else. It is essentially what’s described in the `LineFormatter` interface, but I agree that the names are not great, especially when the reader is forced to contrast them with the stringifier. To discover the right names, perhaps we should make the abstraction more precise. I took some liberties with the typing, but the underlying abstraction is a mechanism for combining _token groups_, with the following signature:\r\n\r\n  - an opaque type `TokenRepresentation`\r\n  - an injection `atom : self -> string -> TokenRepresentation`\r\n  - a reduction `join : self -> TokenRepresentation * TokenRepresentation -> TokenRepresentation`\r\n  - a projection `print : self -> TokenRepresentation -> string`\r\n  - (an endomorphism `next : self -> self`, but this is not relevant right now)\r\n\r\nIn this implementation I’ve let `TokenRepresentation` be literally the type `string`. Then, `atom` is `format`, and `print` is the identity function. However, this means that it is well-typed to `join` strings that are not the result of `format`, or to `format` something twice; neither of these should be possible. Given that this interface is internal, I opted to take the simpler version with fewer coercions, because I can verify that I myself use it correctly throughout this file.\r\n\r\nSo… all this to say that I agree that the names on `LineFormatter` are somewhat confusing, especially when `stringify` is also in the mix. Maybe it’s worth making the notion of token grouping more explicit, and using the names above. I think that that might be less confusing. I’ll give it a shot and see what I think.\r\n\r\nIf we’re bikeshedding on `stringify` vs. `format` for the `T -> string` thing, then I prefer `stringify` because it’s what `JSON.stringify` uses, but if you want to use `format` then I am happy to change it.\r\n\r\n> Alternatively, I think using \"stringify\" as the consistent verb and \"stringifiers\" as the object containing many stringify functions may be even clearer, as it removes ambiguity with the two LineFormatters.\r\n\r\nDropping the part of this that we’ve already addressed, and regarding only `s/const stringify/const stringifiers`: I like this suggestion because then `builders` and `stringifiers`, which are structurally the same (a dictionary of actions) are grammatically consistent. The other nice option is `export const build = { ... }` and `export const stringify = { ... }`; personally, I like this even more, because they read as verbs, and so `build.field(...)` and `stringify.field(...)` seem very clear to me.\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000077\u0000373587825\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"373587825","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"77","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/77#issuecomment-373587825","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"While I’m at it, things I want to change (future PRs):\r\n  - The time system should enforce that lists are homogeneously typed.

I think that that might be less confusing. I’ll give it a shot and see what I think.\r\n\r\nSo… I looked into this. At length. It’s possible, but typing it correctly requires that `inlineFormatter` and `multilineFormatter` and `LineFormatter` each be declared in separate files. (Why? I had foolishly assumed that Flow’s “existential type” represented an existential type, but it does not; instead, it just means “please automatically infer this type and expose it as if I had written it myself”, which is worlds different. Flow does offer opaque types, but only allows scoping the opacity at a module level. Way better than nothing, but a lot of unnecessary cruft.) You can see the result here: https://gist.github.com/wchargin/e890f0cbae10a2d1d32eefd54f5011a5\r\n\r\nThe types are stronger… but at what cost? I like the implementation code more (especially with the explicit projections in `queryDefinition` and `field`). But the user interface is less fluent (see test code). Really, `Stringifier<E>` should be an opaque type, and users should only see a function `stringify: <E, T>(stringifier: Stringifier<E>, element: E, fmt: LineFormatter<T>): string` whose implementation is `fmt.project(stringifier(element, fmt))`. Then users would call `stringify(stringifiers.body, myBody, multilineFormatter(\"  \"))`. Is this the right way to go? The precision of the types makes it easier for a user to understand what’s _actually_ going on, but on the other hand it would be nice if there were nothing _to_ understand, and the former API (as originally in this PR) does a better job of that.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I don’t really want to spend any more time on the fine details of the stringification API right now. As long as it’s internal to our repo, it’s okay if it’s imperfect. There are better things for me to be working on.\r\n\r\nI think that I will keep the API as originally in this PR, but make the following name changes:\r\n  - `builders` becomes `build`;\r\n  - `LineFormatter` becomes `LayoutStrategy`;\r\n  - `LineFormatter.format` becomes `LayoutStrategy.atom`;\r\n  - `multilineFormatter` becomes `multilineLayout`;\r\n  - `inlineFormatter` becomes `inlineLayout`.\r\nIn my opinion, these changes are sufficient to avoid API confusion. Then I can work on more valuable things. :-)\r\n\r\n> A lot of the \"future PR work\" items make more sense if we factor the GraphQL structural query generator out of sourcecred/sourcecred and into its own project.

However, as you say, keeping it explicitly separated in our codebase provides a good defense.

We do not include any information in the payload that is also contained in the address, and the address includes the node type.

As written, the result of `parseAddress` is a union type, so you only know that it is _either_ a node ID or an edge ID. Therefore, you can only perform operations on the result that are valid on _both_ node and edge IDs. In particular, you cannot downcast it to anything.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is all a bit of a sham. You could implement\r\n```js\r\nparseNodeAddress(address: Address): NodeID {\r\n  return JSON.parse(address.id);\r\n}\r\nparseEdgeAddress(address: Address): EdgeID {\r\n  return JSON.parse(address.id);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich is obviously alarming; the only reason that either of these works, let alone both of them, is that `JSON.stringify` returns `any`:\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/469518a07adc8ae2662070f52a1e1ba7b01b5e33/lib/core.js#L481-L482\r\n\r\nSo you are already implicitly, unsafely downcasting from `any` to `NodeID | EdgeID` in the return type of your `parseAddress`.\r\n\r\nNow, I see three potential solutions to the underlying problem. The simplest, cleanest option is to pass around richly typed node IDs wherever you pass nodes. If a function accepts `authorNode: UserNode`, it should also accept `authorNodeID: UserNodeID`. You had well-typed node IDs and you want well-typed node IDs; the problem is the retraction through the untyped string layer, so don’t do that.\r\n\r\nThe next idea is to switch the whole system over to `Address<T: JSONSerializable>` (as previously considered), and parameterize `Graph<NodeID, NodePayload, EdgeID, EdgePayload>`. This would work for the cases in this file, where you only need `NodeID` and not its subtypes, but it is not sufficient in general, and it doesn’t answer your original question of how to get a specific subtype of `NodeID`. The problem is, as you say, that we need to somehow “link” the corresponding address and node types. In other words, nodes’ address-IDs and payloads are not independent; that is, the set of valid types for `(node.address.id, node.payload)` is not the product of the sets of valid types for `node.address.id` and `node.payload`. Our state space is, in a precise sense, _entangled_.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, the last option is to explicitly express the entangled state space in the type system, by parameterizing over a single type that is a carefully chosen subtype of the ID/payload product:\r\n```js\r\ntype Address<+I> = {\r\n  +group: string,\r\n  +id: I,\r\n};\r\ntype Node<+Descriptor> = {\r\n  +address: Address<$ElementType<Descriptor, \"id\">>,\r\n  +payload: $ElementType<Descriptor, \"payload\">,\r\n};\r\n\r\ntype UserNodeDescriptor = {\r\n  id: {\r\n    type: \"USER\",\r\n    id: string,\r\n  },\r\n  payload: {\r\n    login: string,\r\n  },\r\n};\r\ntype IssueNodeDescriptor = {\r\n  id: {\r\n    type: \"ISSUE\",\r\n    id: string,\r\n  },\r\n  payload: {\r\n    title: string,\r\n    number: number,\r\n    body: string,\r\n  },\r\n};\r\ntype GitHubNodeDescriptor = UserNodeDescriptor | IssueNodeDescriptor;\r\ntype GitHubNode = Node<GitHubNodeDescriptor>;\r\n\r\nconst ex1: GitHubNodeDescriptor = {\r\n  id: {type: \"USER\", id: \"01010101\"},\r\n  payload: {login: \"wchargin\"},\r\n};\r\nconst ex2: GitHubNodeDescriptor = {\r\n  id: {type: \"ISSUE\", id: \"23232323\"},\r\n  payload: {title: \"hello\", body: \"world\", number: 1},\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst exBad = {\r\n  id: {type: \"USER\", id: \"01010101\"},\r\n  payload: {title: \"hello\", body: \"world\", number: 1},\r\n}\r\n// $ExpectError\r\n(exBad: GitHubNodeDescriptor);\r\n```\r\nThis should theoretically be strong enough to get us everything that we need. We can see that with the above definitions, a function like\r\n```js\r\nfunction processNode(node: GitHubNode) {\r\n  if (node.address.id.type === \"USER\") {\r\n    console.log(node.payload.login);\r\n  }\r\n  if (node.address.id.type === \"ISSUE\") {\r\n    console.log(node.payload.number);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n_must_ be well-typed: each `if`-statement refines the type of `node`’s descriptor to one of the two branches of `GitHubNodeDescriptor`, and this information is used within the branch. Sadly, Flow is not smart enough to realize that this code is well-typed. A bit of exploration indicates that the root cause is that Flow does not propagate constraints learned from inference across sibling boundaries in an object type ([here is a minimal example][mwe]). Note that making everything exact, read-only, and covariant does not help. (See also: appendix below.)\r\n\r\n[mwe]: https://flow.org/try/#0GYVwdgxgLglg9mABAcznAJgCgJSIN4BQiiUAngA4CmiAGogLz5HGIC2lrARpQE4BcTFizJUBAIgDKAFQBKASQByAcTEAaZkNakJUHjDDIBAZ137k6oQF8LiSwG5mI6gE0Ggluy68BhIcSfiCgCqALIAQgCiMmoaHqQKIF78iGCJ3Dw2xNbM9gTMoJCwCIjAmABeAnQAPojOuL4sMMCI5QB0numtTgz0jJKyiir1scRl7RydWjp6BnbEAPTzKGjoAISxlrFNLWMdvF0U1L19weFRYsN+iLsT+1oJSXOIi8sY61Y5BJsEBdDwSJwAIZYS4kQ60NwNYh7HgARh8IzBokQ-XkyhiVkybFuPAATAirlNTAZjMTzBsbLl-ODXIwodikvD3EIAijTpFoljspocfjmXEHukBKkklzKQ58uA-sVShUITU6vztm0YbCDlQen1pGihvzRuMkrj2toyU8XrweHAeIg+ABaTAbLbNFU4tXdY5s0Ici5664G9JG+5pXhmpYWq02+2OrJfAhAA\r\n\r\nIf the third “clever” solution had worked perfectly with Flow, I might have recommended it. After all, it does identify and attack the fundamental problem in a principled and extensible way, and the runtime elision is exactly the same as it was before (i.e., we didn’t have to change the object structure to capitulate to the type system). Its main downside is probably the performance discussed in #66, et al., and it could be argued that it makes the code harder for a newcomer to understand. But if Flow can’t handle these trivial examples, then the whole thing is moot.\r\n\r\nSo—my recommendation for now remains the same as my previous advice: pass around the IDs without ever dropping the types. It’s possible that this will not scale sufficiently, but it requires minimal effort right now, so let’s give it a shot.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAppendix: to justify my claim that the function `processNode` is provably correct, I’ve ported it to `typed/racket`, which uses a proper occurrence typing system and has no problem inferring the type:\r\n```racket\r\n#lang typed/racket\r\n\r\n(define-type UserId (Pair 'user String))\r\n(define-type UserPayload String)\r\n(define-type UserDesc (Pair UserId UserPayload))\r\n\r\n(define-type IssueId (Pair 'issue String))\r\n(define-type IssuePayload Integer)\r\n(define-type IssueDesc (Pair IssueId IssuePayload))\r\n\r\n(define-type GitHubDesc (U UserDesc IssueDesc))\r\n\r\n;; this type-checks just fine\r\n(: process-desc (-> GitHubDesc Void))\r\n(define (process-desc d)\r\n  (match d\r\n    [(cons (cons 'user id) payload)\r\n     (void (string-length payload))]\r\n    [(cons (cons 'issue id) payload)\r\n     (void (* 2 payload))]))\r\n```\r\nNote that the Racket code is a bit awkward, using cons cells instead of structs everywhere, because Racket naturally lends itself to code that doesn’t need these shenanigans; I had to place down some hoops so that I could jump through them. As a sanity check, note that swapping the two continuations of the `match` form yields the appropriate type errors: if I write `(string-length payload)` in the second clause, I get “expected `UserPayload`, given `IssuePayload`”.\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000081\u0000374007024\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"374007024","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"81","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/81#issuecomment-374007024","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"> On reflection, however, I think that since the GitHub plugin owns these nodes, for the GitHub plugin to view the addresses as transparent is reasonable.\r\n\r\nThis makes sense to me.\r\n\r\n> I don't think we need the performance optimization of passing around the nodeIds separately from the addresses, so I just parsed them from the address where necessary.\r\n\r\nI am okay with this, but only because it is an implementation detail localized to this module.\r\n\r\nOther comments: acknowledged.\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000081\u0000374149224\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"374149224","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"81","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/81#issuecomment-374149224","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"There is a fourth option, which is to make explicit all of the type mappings in function signatures, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n_getNodeIDWithAssertion(n: Node<NodePayload>, t: NodeType): any {\r\n  const id: any = this.parseFromAddress(n.address);\r\n  if (id.type !== t) { throw new Error(\"Type assertion violated\") };\r\n  return id;\r\n}\r\n\r\ngetCommentID(n: Node<CommentNodePayload>): CommentNodeID {\r\n  return this._getNodeIDWithAssertion(n, \"COMMENT\");\r\n}\r\n\r\ngetIssueID(n: Node<IssueNodePayload>): IssueNodeID {\r\n  return this._getNodeIDWithAssertion(n, \"ISSUE\");\r\n}\r\n// and so forth for every Node and Edge type\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is not a bad pattern. It's not super DRY, but it is very easy to read and to consume as an API, and it propagates type information we care about. For the parser code (which is all implementation, not API) there's no need for it, and you'll see in this commit I have adopted your option 1. However, I think we can use this pattern in public APIs we develop to access the GitHub data in a type-aware fashion.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of APIs: this PR does not add any convenient APIs for the GitHub data. Once we start using this data, we'll want those to exist; if you take a look at the test code, you'll see that doing simple tasks like acquiring every comment is cumbersome (and type-ignorant). We're almost certainly going to want an api somewhere that exposes `getAllComments(): GitHubCommentAPIEntity[]`. And it would be really nice if that `GitHubCommentAPIEntity` can have `.author` and `.container` properties so that people who want to find the author don't need to do edge-twiddling like I do in the test code. I considered creating a `GitHubGraph` which extends `Graph<GitHubNode, GitHubEdge>` and adds sugar methods for working with GitHub info in a more convenient fashion, but decided there was a lot of extra API design work that should go into that (how do we make a cohesive experience for inter-graph connections?).\r\n\r\nAlso: the `src` and `dst` pointers on our edges feel like a force fit to me. In the case of the `\"COMMENT\"` relationship, trying to decide which node is the src and which is the dst feels arbitrary. Each edge \"type\" is potentially a different kind of relationship; some of those relationships lend themselves to directional thinking, and some don't. Let's consider replacing `src`, `dst` with names that acknowledge that we can't assume directedness in general. \r\n\r\nAlso: I took your suggestion of not putting `type` in the payload (because it is redundant with the address), but encoding the type in the ID doesn't seem right to me either. It's too opaque; it makes the type inaccessible in general to other plugins, but if I am another plugin connecting into or built on-top of the GH plugin, I want to find out the types of things. I think we should consider making `type` a first-class field on the `Address` object, which means that all `Node`s and `Edge`s get types by default, which should improve interpretability across the graph. The types should be namespaced by plugins, so this can actually replace the pluginName field: e.g. for comments here, the type is `GitHubPlugin-beta.Comment`. Going back to the issue of edge semantics, each Edge type can explicitly define its own semantics on how its `src` and `dst` relate.\r\n\r\n& the code changed, so PTAL. It supports PRs now (but doesn't handle review or commit comments)\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000081\u0000374258715\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"374258715","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"81","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/81#issuecomment-374258715","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"I've only read the first paragraph of your comment (will read the rest later), but if you're willing to do runtime checks then you can improve the statics, too:\r\n```js\r\n_getNodeIDWithAssertion<T: NodeID>(\r\n    n: Node<NodePayload>,\r\n    t: $ElementType<T, \"type\">\r\n): T {\r\n  const id: NodeID = this.parseFromAddress(n.address);\r\n  if (id.type !== t) {\r\n      throw new Error(\"Type assertion violated\");\r\n  }\r\n  return id;\r\n}\r\n\r\ngetCommentID(n: Node<CommentNodePayload>): CommentNodeID {\r\n  return this._getNodeIDWithAssertion(n, \"COMMENT\");\r\n}\r\n\r\ngetIssueNodeID(n: Node<IssueNodePayload>): IssueNodeID {\r\n  return this._getNodeIDWithAssertion(n, \"ISSUE\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n([here is a `flow.org/try` for the above example](https://flow.org/try/#0KYDwDg9gTgLgBDAnmYcCCATDVgGddwC8cA3gD4BQccA1DpLgJYzSIByAhgLbABccuGFEYA7AOYAaKrTAAbAK5jRnHv0HDxU6jUYY1Q0ZIpkAvgG4KFUJFhxRMYFABmHAMapM2PLg4AjWagk0jQcWDj4-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-cVv03FCszQeQYAAC2gaDIyIaQyDgCcoD4x5BLgW8xNCCT0KA0DwMYSDpIwUdfwRDjuN43DChEgs4CEqSdKEuTMMU5TcNYzMERUgTqCEpEUTDCNxPsuBtTZTluTvFyZLcnNgx8o8JM0njROco81LYmydMICTHOuXCJI83VvILCSArzO8MRCziwoLKLrJSVEcgRYgABIegCQLSpQTICwkUtTlxPIrOvDw8ugXAuMYMA+gGXzjxIZCio6rSoG63r+vvY0CNLNBiRyAAJIiCSWs5bgY1xIIMXxOKUkQMX4BrpA4TqoCO1JcJhQr2uzHaOFEQLpsG54RrugMQ0ekRnv6Ga4JxUsKzrNAzjYGs6y2nrZAwS6TuoLYcBDOHrsvMcEXZJxHDzdwXqPN7bt9OBMexkRcb+6dHzm3E7QAMSXWs-TJaocCxqAcBlK6MgxFngDZrLjtRn9opSPGYKjXLxsmvq-sGjKHqerKxcjCSSaR8mBsiq8iemynQq6nqZYGI0hM+mBvt+43MSEtWceAXX0UJ1Dptq1AKqq4Aau6TIHca3FmtaywMlcWQOBwOAnHkMnsLgRHO1pqBAyibwAApxm8dZvAASkF7nHcsSPo4OuBrQGbL0QAdWYLi0HwRxsMyHJc-vPIU+kH5m-qiLxbyapXn4Srqqy13G79gOKBzvYqe2kRBEY5vKbj4AE6TqZcBTkQADp0-wLOLFXJw4BT3RN6zABCQhiBgLOqeoV4uMTgB3OARGAZ+enZ6AU9xV24A4OvYDFwAG5KVDg4DAuI97SDiNQHAMBYwiEYrEAuUdXAxzLplZG6IN6d0wUFHuk88H6XwnAhBJcy4FirtxWunZAGQQ3n7Cs1ZawuigXECghc0HFzLglAsOCuZZF4d3SMeRJ5CLzlTUhUBEGl2AOXKhNcAHYQYaWQkJIyRsKAA))\r\n\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u000081\u0000374277323\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"374277323","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"81","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/81#issuecomment-374277323","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"[draft comment]\r\n\r\n> Speaking of APIs: this PR does not add any convenient APIs for the GitHub data.

The pagination API is only intended to work on the standard query, so we would be violating the contract in the test—in an important way.\r\n\r\nHere are two alternative options:\r\n  - Remove the snapshot assertion entirely. This does not significantly affect the predictive power of the test: the `result` assertion is most important, and the `toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3)` makes sure that we aren’t making spurious requests.\r\n  - Remove the first element from the snapshot array, and instead separately assert that the first argument was `{body: createQuery(), variables}`. This retains the full predictive power of the test, and shrinks the snapshot (but makes the code less uniform).\r\n\r\nThe reason that I included the snapshots was primarily for readers’ benefit, to make it easy to see what the continuation queries looked like. But, in retrospect, perhaps that’s not necessary: a reader who cares about this probably has a working copy of the code and enough understanding of the API to easily add a `console.log` to the right spot in the test.

I think a reasonable resolution is to have `toJSON/fromJSON` methods for all the data that we are explicitly supporting compatibility on, and to treat any data dumped without compatibility as ephemeral.

Suppose, for example, that we got in the habit of making backwards-compatible changes to serialization and recording this as proper [semver] by incrementing the minor or patch values in the version string.

For a real-world example: the Git plugin will probably\r\nallow the user to configure diff settings, like “a change is a complete\r\nrewrite if more than 70% of the file is changed”, or “ignore end-of-line\r\nwhitespace”, or “try harder to detect copies” (these are all real\r\noptions to `git diff`).\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to expect that these options can affect how the\r\nporcelain behaves.

Then we might have code\r\nlike the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass TreeEntryReference extends /* … */ {\r\n  _options: GitPluginOptions;\r\n  constructor(base: NodeReference, options: GitPluginOptions) {\r\n    super(base);\r\n    this._options = options;\r\n  }\r\n  *becomes(): Iterator<TreeEntryReference> {\r\n    for (const neighbor of this.neighbors({…})) {\r\n      const {rewriteProportion} = neighbor.edge.payload;\r\n      const {rewriteThreshold} = this._options;\r\n      if (rewriteProportion >= rewriteThreshold) {\r\n        // This change counts as a rewrite: there’s no edge.\r\n        continue;\r\n      }\r\n      yield /* … */;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nclass GitPluginHandler implements PluginHandler {\r\n  _options: GitPluginOptions;\r\n  constructor(options: GitPluginOptions) {\r\n    this._options = options;\r\n  }\r\n  pluginName() { return GIT_PLUGIN_NAME; }\r\n  createReference(base: NodeReference) {\r\n    switch (base.address.type) {\r\n      case TREE_ENTRY_NODE_TYPE:\r\n        return new TreeEntryReference(base, this._options);\r\n      // …\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  // …\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, attempting to merge graphs with Git plugin handlers with\r\ndifferent settings seems like it _must_ be an error, because any result\r\nwould fail to be a conservative extension of the original graphs.\r\n\r\nGiven that configurability of algorithms and plugins is an important\r\ndesign goal, I’d prefer to think about this more carefully rather than\r\nto just pick something that’s easy to implement and ship it. If you want\r\nto get something in quickly so that we can finish up this redesign and\r\nmove onto more critical-path things, then I’d be happy to put in\r\nsomething that is actually conservative: one option is the code in this\r\nPR, which shifts the responsibility to the caller; another option is\r\nusing reference equality as the congruence, which (while conservative)\r\nis bad for configurability and requires plugins to provide instance\r\ncontrol.

Why is `address.js` this kind of pseudo-private module that shouldn’t be\r\n> directly imported by clients? It could just expose:\r\n> \r\n> ```js\r\n> declare module \"address\" {\r\n>   declare opaque type NodeAddress;\r\n>   declare opaque type EdgeAddress;\r\n>   declare function nodeAddress(parts: $ReadOnlyArray<string>): NodeAddress;\r\n>   declare function edgeAddress(parts: $ReadOnlyArray<string>): EdgeAddress;\r\n>   declare function toParts(address: NodeAddress | EdgeAddress): string[];\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nIn offline discussions, you've noted that it's annoying importing the Graph from one file and the Address type from another. The psuedo-private module means it can be canonically imported `import {Address} from \"../../core/graph\"`, and come with all address methods attached, similar to how if we had used a class to back address, we wouldn't need to import every method individually. \r\n\r\nI'm fine having `Address` be an actual, regular module though.\r\n\r\n> Why export an object `_Address` containing functions? \r\n\r\nConvenience for the caller, to have them all packaged together. (I guess this could be replicated via `import * as Address from \"../../core/address\"`)\r\n\r\n> This is unsafe (callers may freely and typesafely modify the attributes on the object)\r\n\r\nDidn't consider this.\r\n\r\n> and annoying (callers can no longer import individual values). If you\r\nexport values individually, callers can either import them individually\r\nor `import * as Address from \"./address\"` (which _is_ safe).\r\n\r\nYep, maybe that's better.\r\n\r\n> It seems desirable that `NodeAddress` and `EdgeAddress` should be\r\n[declared as opaque subtypes][1] of `string`:\r\n\r\n> ```js\r\n> export opaque type NodeAddress: string = string;\r\n> export opaque type EdgeAddress: string = string;\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nSounds good, happy to do that.\r\n\r\n> I’m not dead-set against using union types in public APIs for things\r\nlike `toParts` and `concat`. However, I thoroughly disagree that this is\r\n“simpler”—one function that has a bounded wildcard with an upper bound\r\nof a union type is clearly more complicated than two monomorphic\r\nfunctions with simple domain and codomain. Is there an advantage here\r\nbesides implementation laziness (no offense)? \r\n\r\nI think we are thinking of \"simplicity\" in different contexts. I'm thinking about simplicity for the caller. The caller can have one set of functions for modifying addresses rather than needing to have functions specialized for node addresses and functions specialized for edge addresses.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity you're describing here - type implementation simplicity - is, imo, less important than API simplicity.\r\n\r\n> That is, under what circumstances is there a value whose type is known to be “either\r\n`NodeAddress` or `EdgeAddress`, but we’re not sure which one”? This\r\ncan’t be a very useful type for callers, because it is incompatible with\r\nevery method on `Graph` (you can’t `addNode` or `hasEdge` or anything,\r\nand with good reason). I’m feeling very “when in doubt, leave it out”.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how you imagine getting that type. Given that the user started with a `NodeAddress`, the polymorphic function will always return a `NodeAddress`, and likewise for `EdgeAddress`. \r\n\r\nConsider the following two snippets of code:\r\n\r\nv1:\r\n```js\r\nconst base = Address.nodeAddress(); // type NodeAddress\r\nconst scoped = Address.append(base, \"github\"); // type NodeAddress\r\nconst thisAddress = Address.append(scoped, this.id); // type NodeAddress\r\nthis.graph.addNode(thisAddress); // no flow error\r\n```\r\n\r\nv2:\r\n```js\r\nconst base = NodeAddress.address(); // type NodeAddress\r\nconst scoped = NodeAddress.append(base, \"github\"); // type NodeAddress\r\nconst thisAddress = NodeAddress.append(scoped, this.id); // type NodeAddress\r\nthis.graph.addNode(thisAddress); // no flow error\r\n```\r\nIn neither case do we ever instantiate something with type `NodeAddress | EdgeAddress`. The difference is the first does it with fewer API elements (since we don't need a separate `EdgeAddress` module).\r\n\r\nGiven that it doesn't produce any type-unsafety, I don't understand opposition to making the Address APIs generic. If we were implementing Python, would the same reasoning suggest that it's better to have `lenOfList` and `lenOfSet` as separate methods?\r\n\r\n> Why allow `nodeAddress` and `edgeAddress` to be called with `undefined`?\r\nThis seems like a great way to mask bugs: if a client passes `undefined`\r\ninstead of an array, it seems at least as likely that the client has a\r\nbug causing their intended-array to be `undefined` than that they\r\nactually want the address given by `[]`. If a client does want this\r\nsemantics, they can just write `myArrayOrUndefined || []`.\r\n\r\nI wanted to write the factory method so that it can be called without arguments to generate a base address. Having looked into this matter a little more, I see that `arguments.length` is a better way to achieve this.\r\n\r\n> The following two tests would have passed in the previous API, but fail\r\n> under the code in this pull request:\r\n\r\nThat's a bug in the implementation, thanks for catching.\r\n\r\n> Note that `typeof NODE | typeof EDGE` is just `Symbol`; there is no\r\nadditional safety granted by using that definition.\r\n\r\nInteresting, I guess using strings is better for that purpose.\r\n\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000334\u0000394251862\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"394251862","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"334","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/334#issuecomment-394251862","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"Will wait on in-person discussion to resolve the contentious bits. :)"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000334\u0000394463159\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"394463159","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"334","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/334#issuecomment-394463159","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"Discussed offline and resolved:\r\n- To have a single `Address` module in favor of separate `NodeAddress` / `EdgeAddress`\r\n- To have the `nodeAddress` and `edgeAddress` functions always require an explicit parts argument\r\n- To rename `address.js` to `_address.js` but not under-name its methods\r\n- To export the `Address`module from `graph.js` as a frozen object.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, things were resolved per William's suggestions."},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000335\u0000125721219\u0000192862766\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"192862766","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125721219","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"335","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/335#discussion_r192862766","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"Not asking for a change (rather, I like that this commit is reproducible\r\nby “run prettier” only), but this `\"\" + ` now seems redundant (yay).\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000339\u0000401516618\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"401516618","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"339","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/339#issuecomment-401516618","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"TODO: Investigate why this did not work.  \r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/sourcecred/sourcecred/builds/398473500"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000339\u0000125749456\u0000192886063\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"192886063","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125749456","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"339","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/339#discussion_r192886063","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"Could you actually use `wchargin+travis-sourcecred@gmail.com` here, please?"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000341\u0000125806397\u0000192934935\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"192934935","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"125806397","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"341","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/341#discussion_r192934935","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"To check my understanding: the problem is that `authorRefs` is an empty\r\narray, right? not an array containing a null element?

We don’t want to roll our own custom UI widgets,\r\nbecause then we have to make sure that they’re accessible,\r\nhigh-performance, consistently designed, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhichever toolkit we select will quickly permeate our frontend, and the\r\ndecision may be hard to change later. Thus, we should choose carefully.\r\n\r\nI’m concerned by the bundle size and build time penalties incurred by\r\nSemantic UI:\r\n\r\n| build ref        | `main.js` size |    build time |\r\n|:-----------------|---------------:|--------------:|\r\n| origin/master    |      439 646 B |      19.112 s |\r\n| origin/ui-update |    1 408 500 B |      39.077 s |\r\n\r\nSemantic UI is adding 968.8 KB to the build, and more than doubling the\r\nbuild time. For comparison, [all of Material-UI is 95.4 KB][mui] (and\r\nMaterial-UI supports directly importing individual components), and\r\n[React itself (16.2.0 + DOM) is 97.5 KB][react].\r\n\r\n(I built against origin/ui-update, not origin/update-navbar, because\r\nthis branch doesn’t actually use `semantic-ui-react`.)\r\n\r\n[mui]: https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/0efc81dad607437fa448d6b19a2c985266790848/.size-limit.js#L27-L30\r\n[react]: https://gist.github.com/Restuta/cda69e50a853aa64912d\r\n\r\nSo, I’d like to consider other options. Material-UI seems well supported\r\nand maintained. React-Bootstrap is fine (I’ve used it in the past), if a\r\nBootstrap-like look is what you’re going for, and Elemental UI looks\r\npretty similar. What else should we be considering?\r\n\r\nI also want to explicitly mention that I value the time and effort that\r\nyou’ve put into this set of changes. In the long run, though, I think\r\nthat it would be a mistake to base an architectural decision like this\r\none around the fact that we already have a bit of code written. Plus,\r\neven if we end up scratching the technical implementation of this\r\nchangeset entirely, your work won’t have been wasted—in addition to the\r\nactual code, you’ve spent time exploring different designs, and become\r\nacquainted with the codebase, tools, and environment. All of that will\r\ncarry over.\r\n\r\n@decentralion: anything I forgot to mention?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnother option that I want to float (though I suspect that it may be an\r\nunpopular suggestion) is to use the unique UI toolkit that adds zero\r\nbuild time and zero bundle size. You can go a long way by just styling\r\nthe standard DOM elements. I’ve used that approach in the past for [this\r\napplication][vt], which doesn’t look half bad, if you ask me. Choosing\r\nto use the standard library is different from rolling your own\r\ncomponents: you get accessibility, performance, etc. for free.\r\n\r\nI’m not saying that we should _definitely_ do this, but I do think that\r\nwe should consider alternatives in terms of their marginal benefits over\r\nusing the standard library.\r\n\r\n[vt]: https://wchargin.github.io/varese/#/tree\r\n"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000PULL\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000552\u0000409703144\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"409703144","parent":{"type":"PULL","number":"552","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/552#issuecomment-409703144","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"decentralion"}],"body":"This looks good to me! \r\nI'm going to let @wchargin give the official approval as I think he's a better reviewer for this code"},"N\u0000sourcecred\u0000github\u0000COMMENT\u0000REVIEW\u0000sourcecred\u0000sourcecred\u0000552\u0000141302243\u0000205927783\u0000":{"address":{"type":"COMMENT","id":"205927783","parent":{"type":"REVIEW","id":"141302243","pull":{"type":"PULL","number":"552","repo":{"type":"REPO","owner":"sourcecred","name":"sourcecred"}}}},"url":"https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/552#discussion_r205927783","authors":[{"type":"USERLIKE","subtype":"USER","login":"wchargin"}],"body":"Styles like `nav` don’t need to be used by any other modules—and indeed\r\nshould not be.

You’ve a couple times\r\nnow written code of the form\r\n\r\n```js\r\n        const totalScore = aggregation.connections.reduce(\r\n          (val, connection) => val + connection.connectionScore,\r\n          0\r\n        );\r\n```\r\n\r\n, which can be rewritten as\r\n\r\n```js\r\n        const scores = aggregation.connections.map((x) => x.connectionScore);\r\n        const totalScore = scores.reduce((a, b) => a + b);\r\n```\r\n\r\n. I posit that the latter is better, both for “ivory-tower” “purity”\r\nreasons\\* and for practical reasons. The practical reason is simply the\r\nfollowing: while it is not _difficult_ to rederive at each occasion\r\nwhether the accumulator or the next item comes as the first argument to\r\nthe callback, it requires active thought each time that you read the\r\ncode (for me, at least, and I’m not alone). When your accumulator type\r\nis different from your element type, the order matters. When you map\r\nfirst so that everything is homogeneous, it doesn’t.\\*\\*\r\n\r\nI think that this is consonant with the principle that code is read much\r\nmore often than it’s written; the obviously correct version is better\r\nthan the slightly-nonobviously correct version.\r\n\r\nAnother practical reason is that it’s impossible to get wrong if you map\r\nfirst and then reduce. If you got the arguments wrong here, you’d get\r\n`0` for an empty array or `\"[object Object]undefined\"` for a nonempty\r\narray. Sure, tests will catch it, but why bother tracking down that bug?\r\n\r\n\\* The ivory-tower reason is roughly that when you perform a true\r\n_reduction_, as opposed to a fold, you have much more freedom in terms\r\nof execution strategy. For instance, it is trivial to parallelize a\r\nreduction, but it is impossible to parallelize a fold. This really does\r\nmatter in principle (you sacrifice O(log *n*) for O(*n*)), but in\r\npractice this code is not parallel, and if we want to make it parallel\r\nthen we can trivially make the transformation.\r\n\r\n\\*\\* This is true even if the operator is non-commutative—ask me for\r\ndetails if you care.\r\n\r\nSo—I care about this enough to write my own code in my preferred style,\r\nand I want to let you know where I’m coming from.
